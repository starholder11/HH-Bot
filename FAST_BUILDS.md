# 🚀 Fast Docker Build Strategies

## Problem
- Current builds take **45+ minutes** 
- Unacceptable for rapid iteration and testing
- Most time spent on `npm install` and Next.js build

## Solutions (Pick One)

### ⚡ Option 1: Ultra-Fast Cache Mounts (RECOMMENDED)
**Build Time: 1-3 minutes after first build**

```bash
# First build (still slow, but creates cache)
./scripts/ultra-fast-build.sh

# Subsequent builds (1-3 minutes!)
./scripts/ultra-fast-build.sh --push
```

**How it works:**
- Uses Docker BuildKit cache mounts
- Persists `node_modules` and `.next/cache` across builds
- Only rebuilds changed code

### 🏗️ Option 2: Pre-built Base Image
**Build Time: 2-5 minutes**

```bash
# One-time setup (build base with dependencies)
./scripts/build-base-image.sh

# Fast builds using cached base
./scripts/fast-build.sh --push
```

**How it works:**
- Pre-builds image with all dependencies
- Fast builds only copy source and build

### 🐌 Option 3: Current Production Build
**Build Time: 45+ minutes**

```bash
# Current slow method
docker build -t hh-bot:latest .
```

## Recommendation

**Use Option 1 (Ultra-Fast)** for development:
- Fastest iteration (1-3 minutes)
- Uses Docker's built-in caching
- No additional setup required

**Use current Dockerfile** for production:
- More predictable builds
- Smaller final image size
- Better for CI/CD pipelines

## Quick Start

```bash
# Set up environment
export REDIS_URL="your-redis-url"

# Ultra-fast build and deploy
./scripts/ultra-fast-build.sh --push
```

## Cache Management

If builds get corrupted or you need a clean build:

```bash
# Clear Docker build cache
docker builder prune

# Then rebuild
./scripts/ultra-fast-build.sh
```
