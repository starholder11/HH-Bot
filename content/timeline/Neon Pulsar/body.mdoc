### Shards of The Horizon Lyrics

(Verse 1)

In a world that's changing, hearts rearranging,

We chase the shadows, we run from the light,

Eyes fixed on screens, we dream in binary,

But hold on tight, we'll make it right.

(Chorus)

Shards of horizon, pieces of tomorrow,

We'll gather them up, no time for sorrow,

Hand in hand, we'll face the storm,

We are alive, reborn, transformed.

(Verse 2)

Static and signals, cold empty echoes,

Lost in the circuits, we search for a path,

But we are the future, love's great adventurers,

With every beat, we find our way back.

(Chorus)

Shards of horizon, pieces of tomorrow,

We'll gather them up, no time for sorrow,

Hand in hand, we'll face the storm,

We are alive, reborn, transformed.

  
(Bridge)

Dance in the night, let go of despair,

We'll find each other, love's electric flare,

Connect the fragments, build something new,

With hearts aflame, we'll break on through.

(Chorus)

Shards of horizon, pieces of tomorrow,

We'll gather them up, no time for sorrow,

Hand in hand, we'll face the storm,

We are alive, reborn, transformed.

(Outro)

We are the pulse, the rhythm, the song,

In the chaos, we'll find where we belong,

Shards of horizon, we'll never be alone,

We're home.
