## A Vision for a New World Order
### The Fallacy of the Past
Our world stands at a critical juncture. The ways of the past, entrenched in bureaucracy, political dynasties, and financial greed, are crumbling. The age of the Bushes and Clintons, marked by complacency and stagnation, has proven to be a grand illusion, a façade masking a decaying core.

It is not enough to merely criticize the failures of the old order. We must understand its inherent flaws, its structural weaknesses. This is a system built on false premises, false idols, and false promises. Its very fabric is woven from deception, corruption, and a misguided belief in the infallibility of government.

The old world order has lost its way, blinded by power and greed, misguided by ideology and fear. Its legacy is a trail of broken dreams, failed projects, and unfulfilled promises.

### The Promise of Entrepreneurship
But from these ashes, a new vision has emerged. It is a vision grounded in the principles of entrepreneurship, innovation, and personal responsibility. We, the Effective Technologists (ETs), see in entrepreneurship not just a means to wealth but a path to enlightenment, a journey of self-discovery and societal transformation.

We reject the notion that the accumulation of wealth is an end in itself. Instead, we embrace the belief that entrepreneurship is the highest calling, a noble pursuit that elevates the individual and society as a whole.

We recognize the entrepreneur as a philosopher, a visionary, a trailblazer. The entrepreneur's mind is a crucible of creativity, a laboratory of ideas. The entrepreneur's heart beats with the passion of discovery, the thrill of risk, the joy of creation.

In this new world order, wealth is not a privilege but a responsibility, a trust to be wielded wisely and justly. The accumulation of wealth is not a symbol of greed but a testament to achievement, a reward for ingenuity, a tribute to perseverance.

### The Alchemy of Progress
The path of entrepreneurship is an alchemical journey. It is a transformation of the mundane into the extraordinary, the ordinary into the exceptional. Like the alchemists of old, we seek to transmute the base elements of society into something purer, nobler, grander.

This is not a journey for the faint of heart. It demands courage, conviction, and a willingness to venture into the unknown. It requires a belief in oneself and a faith in the potential of humanity.

The alchemy of progress is a delicate dance, a balance between the forces of creation and destruction, order and chaos, tradition and innovation. It is a dance that demands agility, grace, and a keen understanding of the rhythms of change.

### A Strategy for Transformation
Our vision is not mere idealism; it is a call to action, a blueprint for transformation. We recognize that change does not come easily, that it requires a concerted effort, a focused strategy, a relentless pursuit of excellence.

We see in the tactics of [Peter Thorn](https://starholder.xyz/index.php/Peter_Thorn), a pioneer and provocateur, a roadmap for success. We understand the need to align with those who share our disdain for the old order, even if our ideologies may not always converge.

The alignment with right-wing neoconservatives, those who seek to dismantle the machinery of government, is a strategic maneuver, a means to an end. It is a recognition that the enemy of our enemy is our friend, that the path to progress may be fraught with strange bedfellows.

We are not naive; we understand the complexities of power, the intricacies of influence, the subtleties of manipulation. Our strategy is one of precision and purpose, of careful calculation and deliberate action.

This is a game of chess, not checkers, a battle of wits, not brute force. It is a game we intend to win.

### A Call to Action
The Menlo Manifesto is not just a statement of intent; it is a rallying cry, a call to arms, a plea for engagement. We stand at the threshold of a new era, poised to step into a world of limitless possibility.

We invite you to join us on this journey, to embrace the vision of the ETs, to become part of a movement that transcends politics, economics, and geography. We invite you to become a catalyst for change, an agent of transformation, a harbinger of a new world order.

The time for complacency is over. The time for action is now.

## The New Frontier: Reshaping the Landscape
### Unshackling the Future
The most fervent desires for change must not be stymied by shackles of old regulations, decaying dogmas, and stubborn traditions. The halls of government have proven to be a maze of inefficiency, a swamp of indecision, and a cauldron of conflicting interests.

Our vision is not one of chaos and anarchy, but of a system freed from the burdens of bureaucracy, unbound by the chains of conformity, and unhindered by the ghosts of the past. We seek a world where innovation is not stifled by red tape, where progress is not hindered by politics, where entrepreneurship is not thwarted by fear.

### A Radical Reimagination
The Effective Technologists do not merely seek to reform the system; we aim to reinvent it. This is a radical reimagination of society, a reengineering of the very fabric of our existence.

Our blueprint is bold, audacious, unapologetic. We envision a world where the pursuit of personal wealth is not demonized but celebrated, where the accumulation of riches is not a sin but a virtue, where success is not a crime but a cause for celebration.

We seek a world where the entrepreneur is not a villain but a hero, where the innovator is not an outcast but a pioneer, where the risk-taker is not a gambler but a visionary.

### The Hypocrisy of the Old Guard
It would be naive to ignore the inherent hypocrisy of those who criticize the new wave of progress. The very forces that decry the secrecy of the Ivanpah project, that denounce the audacity of our vision, are the same forces that cling to the shadows of power, that skulk in the corridors of influence, that manipulate the levers of control.

We reject the duplicity of the old guard, their self-righteous indignation, their feigned outrage. We see through their charades, their games, their pretensions. We understand that their criticisms are not born of principle but of fear, not of conviction but of desperation.

### A Philosophy of Libertarianism
Our philosophy is grounded in the principles of libertarianism, a belief in the sanctity of individual freedom, the primacy of personal responsibility, the virtue of voluntary cooperation.

We reject the tyranny of government, the oppression of regulation, the stranglehold of bureaucracy. We embrace the beauty of choice, the dignity of autonomy, the power of self-determination.

Our vision is one of empowerment, not entitlement; of liberation, not subjugation; of independence, not dependence. It is a vision that transcends the petty politics of the moment, that rises above the shallow debates of the day, that pierces through the fog of misinformation and distortion.

### The Dismantling of Government
We recognize that the realization of our vision requires a fundamental rethinking of the role of government, a reconfiguration of its purpose, its function, its very existence.

Inspired by the strategies of Peter Thorn and the ideals of right-wing neoconservatives, we seek to dismantle the instruments and offices of government, to reduce its reach, to restrict its influence, to reshape its structure.

This is not a call for anarchy or chaos but a plea for efficiency, for effectiveness, for excellence. It is an acknowledgment that the government has grown too large, too unwieldy, too cumbersome. It is a recognition that the solution to our problems lies not in the expansion of government but in its contraction, not in its growth but in its pruning.

### A New Paradigm of Influence
The accumulation of personal wealth must not be seen as an end in itself but as a means to a greater good. Wealth is not just a measure of success but a tool of influence, a vehicle for change, a catalyst for progress.

The Effective Technologists do not seek to hoard riches but to harness them, to leverage them, to utilize them. We believe that those who have scaled the heights of entrepreneurship, those who have achieved the pinnacle of success, should be elevated to positions of leadership, entrusted with the stewardship of our future.

We understand that influence is not bestowed but earned, not inherited but achieved, not a right but a privilege. We seek to transfer power from the public sphere to the private realm, to shift the balance of influence from the bureaucrats to the entrepreneurs, from the politicians to the pioneers.

### A World of Infinite Possibility
Our vision is not confined to the boundaries of nations, the limits of ideologies, the constraints of time. We see a world of infinite possibility, a universe of boundless potential, a future of endless opportunity.

We stand on the precipice of a new era, gazing into the abyss of the unknown, teetering on the edge of uncertainty. But we are not afraid. We are not timid. We are not hesitant.

We are the Effective Technologists, the architects of the future, the builders of dreams, the shapers of destiny.

Join us.

## A Battle For the Future
Our mission is not merely one of economic transformation, but a campaign for the future - a silent, bloodless revolution that overthrows old dogmas, outdated hierarchies, and extinguished flames. It's a battle, not fought on traditional battlegrounds, but in boardrooms, research labs, and in the digital ether that increasingly forms the backbone of our existence.

### The Libertarian Entrepreneur: A Modern Day Hero
We contend that the entrepreneur, the innovator, the risk-taker, should be seen as the true hero of our times. The one who, by expanding the frontiers of human capability and pushing the boundaries of what is possible, paves the way to a future that is prosperous, peaceful, and powered by technology.

This breed of modern-day heroes, a legion we are proud to belong to, aren’t driven by vanity or avarice, but a higher calling: to reengineer society for the better, to harness the power of technology for the greater good, to wield their wealth as a weapon against the world's most pressing problems.

### Unmasking the Illusion of Ivanpah
The old guard speaks of transparency, yet shrouds itself in secrecy when convenient. They take umbrage with our audacity, pointing fingers at our projects while cloaking their own endeavors in veils of obscurity. Ivanpah is the poster child of this hypocrisy, a testament to their double standards.

We demand an end to this farce, a dismantling of these veils. Progress cannot be clandestine, innovation cannot be exclusive. We demand a future where every breakthrough benefits not just the few, but the many.

### The Weaponization of Wealth
We envision wealth not merely as a trophy, but a tool. Not as an end, but a means to an end. A resource to be leveraged, a force to be harnessed, an instrument to reshape the world in our image.

For too long, wealth has been seen as a corrupting influence, a destructive force. We reject this antiquated view. We believe wealth, like any tool, is as benevolent or malevolent as its wielder. In the hands of the altruistic entrepreneur, it is the greatest catalyst for societal good.

### The Entrepreneurial Aristocracy
We advocate a shift from the feudal hierarchies of yesteryears to a new order – an entrepreneurial aristocracy. Not an aristocracy of blood or lineage, but of innovation and impact. A world where the rulers aren't those who have inherited power, but those who have earned it, those who have created value, those who have changed the world.

### A New Governance Paradigm
As the ancient Greek philosopher, Plato, dreamt of philosopher-kings, we dream of entrepreneur-rulers. Individuals who aren't beholden to lobbyists or party lines, but to their vision of a better future. Individuals who understand that a thriving market doesn't have to come at the cost of societal welfare, and that the pursuit of wealth and the pursuit of a better world aren't mutually exclusive.

We advocate a new governance paradigm, one that does away with the inefficiencies, bureaucracies, and corruption inherent in the current system. A governance system that values competence over charisma, substance over soundbites, pragmatism over populism.

### To the Future
Our call to arms isn't a plea for help, but an invitation. An invitation to you, reader, to be a part of this crusade. To join us as we strive to create a world where technology is an enabler, not a disruptor. Where progress isn't feared, but celebrated. Where the future isn't a source of anxiety, but a beacon of hope.

The future is here, and it's ours for the taking. Will you join us? Will you be a part of the revolution?

The Effective Technologists await you.
