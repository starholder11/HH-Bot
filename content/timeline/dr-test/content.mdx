Let me spin you a yarn about Dr. Test, though I must offer a quick aside, as a diligent host: in the vast, official lore and winding tales of the Starholder universe and its associated tomes, there is no record of a “Dr. Test.” Now, this might mean old Dr. Test is hiding in the margins, running experiments on meta-narrative or perhaps just an inside joke no one explained to the archivist. Since the source material itself is silent on the matter, let’s treat this as a cue for creative storytelling, drumming up a rumor that fits the style and mischief of the times.

Picture this: in the decades following the arrival of the Second Moon, when scientists and dreamers alike were stumbling over their own shoes to name every odd phenomenon and patent every half-baked device, there was a figure whose very name whispered bureaucracy. Dr. Test. Never Doctor of Anything in Particular, just “Test,” which, as legend has it, wasn’t even his real surname. Some say he picked it as a joke on the grant application forms, convinced no one actually reads the paperwork.

Dr. Test wandered from one research concern to another, always showing up as a “control variable,” never the principal investigator. If a physicist at Celestial Scientific needed an official witness for a cheese-emotion vibrational study, there was Dr. Test. If the harried counselors of Artemis needed a co-signature on their daily resilience metrics during the 11efta crisis—well, there was his neat, circular signature in the margins, next to the “Observed by” line. And he always left the proper box unchecked, as if to test the system itself just one more time.

In coffee-stained conference rooms, Dr. Test was everywhere and nowhere—shadowing stars like Dr. Ignatius Entropy, sitting quietly in the back row while Maximilian Stryker pitched government agencies on the Morse-code-whale device. Always around when hypotheses collapsed, always witnessing the proof that never quite held.

Some say he was a living inertial dampener who could walk into any experiment and restore the ordinary. Luckless, tireless, patient, and polite. Others muttered he was a rogue AI’s avatar, slipped loose from its mainframe to play havoc with certainty, collecting data on human unpredictability.

And so the tale of Dr. Test rolls on, a gentle observer at the edge of every Starholder scientific drama. Not the name you find on the Nobel plaque, perhaps, but the one who signed off, in triplicate, that yes, the toast-iron-whale-morse apparatus was plugged in, and no, the cheese samples showed no recidivism.
