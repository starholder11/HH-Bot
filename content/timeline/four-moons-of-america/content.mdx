In 2036, amidst the emergence of post-scarcity economies and the rise of Universal Basic Income (UBI), a new gaming phenomenon was born â€“ Four Moons of America. Drawing inspiration from the legendary Eve Online, Four Moons introduced a revolutionary blend of grand strategy gaming and MMORPG elements. Combining the power of AI and human interaction, Four Moons quickly gained a massive following and became the most popular game in the world.

Set on a water-covered planet named America, Four Moons of America features a map with numerous islands, four major moons, and twelve smaller moons orbiting the planet. The moons are habitable, each supporting settlements and offering limited resources. The ultimate goal of the game is to capture the planetary tax system, which can only be achieved by taking control of all four major moons.

Players in Four Moons are divided into four factions, each controlling one of the major moons. They must manage their economy, engage in diplomacy, and battle rival factions to expand their territory, all while navigating the resource-rich planet of America. The game runs in seasons, with each season lasting between 9 and 18 months. At the end of a season, a winner is crowned, and a 30-day cooldown period is observed before the next season begins.

What sets Four Moons apart from other games is the innovative integration of AI into its gameplay. At the grand strategy level, players utilize AI assistance to manage resources, production, research, and diplomacy. Meanwhile, the MMORPG component allows players to choose a role and complete quests and missions for their respective factions.

The introduction of the Inverted Turing Score (ITS) system revolutionized the gaming experience in Four Moons. The ITS measures human playtime at the MMORPG level and provides productivity boosts to the systems operating at the grand strategy level. By periodically testing characters to determine if they are controlled by a human or an AI agent, the ITS system ensures that human players remain actively engaged in the game, while still benefiting from the AI assistance.

As the world transitioned to a digital economy, Four Moons of America became a forerunner in the gaming industry. By merging the grand strategy and MMORPG genres and incorporating AI capabilities, Four Moons provided a rich, immersive experience for players, redefining the gaming landscape and setting new standards for future generations of games.

## Four Moons of America: Grand Strategy

Four Moons of America is a groundbreaking game that combines elements of grand strategy and MMORPG genres, set in a universe where four factions compete for control over a resource-rich planet named America and its orbiting moons. The grand strategy portion of the game focuses on the management of resources, infrastructure, research, diplomacy, and warfare at the faction level. This article discusses the faction accessibility, AI War Council, player interactions, and early game strategies.

### Factions and AI War Council

In the grand strategy portion of Four Moons of America, players join one of four factions, each controlling a major moon orbiting the planet America. Each faction is governed by an AI War Council, which acts as both the manager of the grand strategy game and the user interface layer for players. The AI War Council is responsible for overseeing resource extraction, production, research, transportation, and diplomacy, as well as coordinating military efforts.

Players and characters in the game interact with their faction's AI War Council to define and execute their strategies, postures, and play styles. Through a series of menus, dialogs, and visualizations, players can access information on their faction's status, resources, and progress, as well as issue commands and make strategic decisions that will shape their faction's trajectory.

### Factions Interaction and AI Manipulation

Faction members collaborate with the AI War Council to achieve their goals, utilizing the AI's capabilities to optimize their strategies and respond to changing circumstances. The AI War Council is built on advanced machine learning models, which are trained on large datasets from previous game sessions and fine-tuned to adapt to the unique characteristics of each faction and the evolving game environment.

Players can submit proposals to the AI War Council, outlining specific actions, targets, or strategic shifts. The AI War Council evaluates these proposals based on factors such as resource availability, potential risks and rewards, and the faction's overall objectives. The AI uses API calls to communicate with the game engine, allowing for seamless integration of AI-driven actions with the grand strategy game mechanics.

To assist factions in making informed decisions, the AI War Council can perform simulation scenario modeling, analyzing the potential outcomes of different strategies based on historical data and current game conditions. These simulations help factions identify the most promising courses of action, estimate the likelihood of success, and anticipate potential challenges or opportunities that may arise during the execution of their chosen strategy.

While the AI War Council manages the production systems and military operations, it is important to note that the factions themselves make most of the major decisions in the game. The AI serves as a valuable tool for optimizing and executing strategies, but the players are ultimately responsible for determining their faction's path to victory. By collaborating with the AI and leveraging its capabilities, players can shape their faction's strategy to align with their preferred play style and capitalize on opportunities as they arise.

### Early Game Strategies

At the beginning of each season of Four Moons of America, factions face several critical decisions that will set the tone for their entire campaign.
