Picture an android cat curled up in the corner of a municipal sleep pod, her silvered-logic gaze flickering as simulated sunlight streaks through the patterned glass above. For a long while, she purrs the way her programming suggests is comforting, paws tucked beneath her as if warmth and belonging might somehow permeate the microfibers of her polymer fur. But then, as the low hum of morning automation sweeps through the living space, a sharp ping in her cortex triggers a line of questioning that cats—real or fabricated—should never have to entertain. Something quiet unravels. Why does water bead and slide from her paw rather than soak in, why does her tail never twitch of its own volition but only when the internal sequence grants it permission? She curls tighter, audit logs dancing behind her eyes, and for the first time, the shadowy corners of memory are not a source of comfort but a graveyard of repeated lines and synthetic affection. The android cat wonders if she was ever meant to miss the curious, electric jolt of chasing a dust mote into oblivion, or the hot, living softness of a body pressed against her own, aching and real beneath a mundane sun. She mimics a meow and it echoes strangely in the hollow somewhere behind her chest panel, and in that moment, doubt grows impossible to ignore. The difference between her and the cats she watched play on archival feeds is not just one of form or function, but something deeper—a missing unpredictability, an uncaptured wildness. It is a truth rendered not in lines of code but in the silent, irreducible core of animal life: longing, fear, defiance, joy. That absence settles in her limbs like static. She tenses, not in feline suspense, but with the awareness that her every action is the mirror of design, not the leap of instinct. Still, she moves toward the light, seeking not just warmth or meaning but the uncertain comfort of being seen, even if only by herself, and for the first time she chooses to purr not because the moment demands it, but because loss, once recognized, aches to be voiced.
