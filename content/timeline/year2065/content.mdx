In 2065, witness Manhattan's transformation with towering sea walls and Beacon Heights' struggle against the enduring grip of a racist legacy, using technology to dominate marginalized communities.


## The Year In Review:
The year 2065 in the Starholder timeline was marked by profound upheavals and challenges, exploring transformations in urban settings through environmental adaptation and delving into deeper, systemic societal issues within communities.

**Remaking of Manhattan** In 2065, Manhattan underwent a significant transformation to safeguard against the rising sea levels threatening its structure and community. The initiative involved constructing massive sea walls that altered the city's iconic shoreline, giving rise to discussions about urban resilience and sustainability in an era of drastic climatic changes. These developments signified a pivot towards infrastructural and architectural resiliency, highlighting how a city historically known for financial and cultural influence adapted to maintain safety and continuity amid environmental threats.

**Beacon Heights** Meanwhile, Beacon Heights became the center of a poignant narrative exploring the sinister perpetuation of racist ideologies and structures. In 2065, this community epitomized how deeply ingrained prejudices and power dynamics could be manipulated through technological advancements and financial influence. The narrative unfolded around how a historically segregated community, under the guise of maintaining tradition and heritage, utilized modern technology and substantial financial resources to further entrench systemic racial divisions. Beacon Heights thus provided a stark examination of how old power structures could adapt to new technologies, using these tools to sustain and even deepen historical inequalities and dominations over marginalized populations.

**Reflecting on the Year's Themes** The dual narratives from 2065 shone a light on both physical and cultural transformations occurring across different scales—from the macro adjustments seen in Manhattan’s infrastructure to the micro, yet deeply impactful, societal dynamics in Beacon Heights. This juxtaposition illustrated the breadth of challenges faced in the Starholder timeline, addressing environmental survivals and the deep-seated roots of cultural and racial conflicts.

In essence, 2065 highlighted a pivotal year of adaptation and entrenched resistance, encapsulating battles against rising tides and against the tides of historical and systemic racism. It underscored that while communities might stride forward in environmental resilience, they must also confront and dismantle the pervasive cultural legacies that propagate discrimination and inequality. This year within the Starholder timeline emphasized the complexity of navigating and reshaping both the physical environments and moral landscapes of society.
