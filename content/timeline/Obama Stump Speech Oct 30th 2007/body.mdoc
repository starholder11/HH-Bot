[Obama walks up to the podium, flashes a smile, the crowd erupts in applause]

Thank you, thank you. Now, there's something I've got to talk about tonight. Something that's been on my mind.

You know, it's easy to forget when we're here in this room, surrounded by friends and supporters, that there's a world outside. A world that's being shaped and reshaped every day by decisions made in the highest offices of our nation.

And sometimes, those decisions don't reflect the values we hold dear, the American values of fairness, opportunity, and justice for all. I'm speaking, of course, about the deal between the Bush administration and the man they call "The Architect."

Now, let me be clear. There's nothing wrong with aspiration, nothing wrong with big dreams and groundbreaking ventures. That's part of what makes America, America. But, when those ventures are funded not just with private dollars, but with the hard-earned money of the American taxpayer, we ought to pay attention.

We've seen it time and time again in this administration - special interests getting their way while the rest of us watch from the sidelines. The game is rigged, and the average American is left out in the cold. The big corporations get the tax breaks, the sweetheart deals, the inside track... and what do we get? We get the bill.

[Pauses, looks out over the crowd]

You know, there's something absurd about all this. It's like we're living in an episode of The Twilight Zone. We're here, in the real world, struggling with real problems - with healthcare, with education, with job security - and yet, our government is up there, orbiting some other planet, playing with super colliders and the fortunes of reclusive billionaires.

[Laughs, shakes head]

Sorry, I didn't mean to go off-script there. But sometimes you've got to call it like you see it.

[Returns to script]

It's time for a change, America. It's time for a government that prioritizes you - the hardworking people who build this nation day by day. It's time to put an end to backroom deals and special interests. It's time to refocus our nation on what truly matters.

We're on the brink of a new era, an era that demands fresh thinking, bold leadership, and a recommitment to the values that have made America great. Let's reprioritize. Let's refocus. Let's ensure that the American dream is a dream for all, not just a privileged few.

We have the opportunity to send a clear message to Washington. That we're tired of politics as usual. That we're ready for change. That we believe in an America that's unified, equitable, and just. This is our moment. This is our time. Let's seize it together.

Thank you, and God bless you all. God bless the United States of America.
