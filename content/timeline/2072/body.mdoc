## The Year In Review:

The year 2072 in the Starholder timeline is marked by intense ideological battles, personal struggles, and groundbreaking corporate maneuvers as society navigates the continuing impact of the mysterious Second Moon. The year unfolds beneath the extended shadow of this celestial anomaly, influencing political, personal, and professional spheres in profound and sometimes disturbing ways.

In Austin, Texas, a significant meeting takes place, involving key figures of the neoconservative movement. This gathering, dubbed the "War on God," revolves around strategic discussions aimed at deciphering and harnessing the societal shifts triggered by the Second Moon's appearance. The conversations reflect a deep-seated desire to control or influence the narrative surrounding this event, viewing it as a pivotal opportunity to reaffirm certain ideological stances in the face of a society that is increasingly questioning traditional structures and beliefs.

Parallel to the political machinations, the year also delves into the personal story of Selene, as portrayed in "Shadows of Selene." In the confines of a therapist's office, far removed from the political arenas, Selene's interactions with Dr. Lara Mendel unveil the psychological and emotional toll of living in a world where reality is constantly questioned. Her character's journey underscores the broader theme of seeking truth and stability in an era dominated by profound uncertainty and the pervasive influence of the hyperreal.

Meanwhile, the corporate world sees significant developments with the rise of Celestial Scientific, a corporation that quickly capitalizes on the intrigue and scientific potential presented by the Second Moon. The company's aggressive pursuits not only highlight the economic opportunities afforded by the new celestial body but also exemplify the commodification of cosmic phenomena—turning scientific inquiry into a spectator sport fueled by public fascination and fear.

These strands of political ambition, personal search for meaning, and corporate opportunism intertwine throughout 2072, painting a complex portrait of a world grappling with unprecedented challenges. The fabric of society is tested as each sector—political, individual, and corporate—reacts to and tries to make sense of the continuing mysteries of the Second Moon. The year reflects a tension between exploitation and exploration, control and understanding, each playing out against the backdrop of a society ever more entangled with virtual realities and existential questions.

As 2072 draws to a close, the impacts of these events create ripples that promise to shape the future interactions and understandings of the Starholder society. With the omnipresent Second Moon as a catalyst, the year challenges characters, institutions, and indeed the whole of humanity to confront their beliefs, fears, and ambitions in a world where the lines between the cosmic, the virtual, and the real are increasingly blurred.
