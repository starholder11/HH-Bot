By the time the [Second Moon](Second Moon) became visible in the night sky of 2071, society had been thoroughly marinated in the <hyperreal>. Digital worlds had proliferated to such an extent that most people lived lives deeply entrenched in simulations, alternate realities, and virtual spaces that catered to every possible preference and desire. The raw, unvarnished physical world had, for many, become a gray counterpart to the technicolor vibrancy of their chosen realities. So, when the announcement of the Second Moon broke across different platforms, it was through the prism of disbelief and resistance that many perceived this news.

To the citizens who had their existences interwoven with the digital fabric, the idea of the Second Moon was not just implausible; it was an unwelcome distraction. Alt-realities had maturely crafted perfection beyond the limitations of physics; celestial phenomena had become mere backdrops to the grand stages people occupied online. To be coerced into engaging with a physical occurrence of such import implied an abandonment of the pleasurable illusions that defined their lives.

This was more than an annoyance; it was perceived as a tactic to invoke a collective 'reality check', to re-anchor society in a universal physical experience that many had happily left behind. To the skeptics, it made sense that after the [Depop Drama](Depop Drama)—where the deep state was believed to manipulate societal threads through climate crises and population control—the Second Moon might be another coercive stratagem. This theory declared that the moon was part of an agenda to pull people back from their digital escapes, to reinstate a degree of control lost to the hyperreal. Perhaps, as some vocal dissenters posited, the sighs of relief from governments around the world at this celestial phenomenon's emergence were sighs not of cosmic awe but of political opportunism.

Discussions raged in virtual forums and virtual reality talk shows about the true nature of the Second Moon. Theories proliferated that it was merely the latest iteration of deep fake technology—crafted and projected into the sky as a digital monolith, an immersive illusion designed to shock the hyperreal populace back into the plodding step of the single reality. A nostalgia for the blissful ignorance afforded by their digital sanctuaries permeated the collective mood.

In this climate of disbelief, the Lunarian Truthers, veterans of skepticism from the days of the [Depop Drama](Depop Drama), redirected their focus skyward. They surmised that just as AI-driven rationing and health crises had been the velvet glove over the iron fist of population control, so too might the Second Moon be a velvet curtain, drawn over the world's gaze to hide or distract from more insidious actions.

These Truthers asserted that the anomaly in orbit was not an alien craft or natural satellite, but a carefully orchestrated event by those in power—a sleight of hand on a cosmic scale. Clues were sought not in the physical sightings of the celestial body itself but in the digital records, the news clips doctored too perfectly, the reactions of politicians too coordinated, too calm. The authenticity of every broadcast was scrutinized, every pixel of the Second Moon dissected for signs of the lie.

It was a topsy-turvy inversion of the common sci-fi narrative; instead of disbelieving denizens needing proof of the extraordinary, the Starholder denizens demanded proof of the ordinary, of authenticity. And as the storyline of the Second Moon entwined with the living legend of the Depop Drama, the question was not so much what was in the sky, but what right it had to pull the people from their preferred plane of existence.

In essence, the narrative around the Second Moon and the skepticism it incurred was merely the latest chapter in humanity's ongoing dialogue with reality—especially a humanity that had learned to mistrust not just what they saw but where they saw it. The digital worlds had become domains of comfort, and the accusation of the Second Moon being a psyop was, above all, a defiant refusal to leave those spaces behind—an insistence that in their hyperreality, they found something far closer to home than the cold, indifferent expanse of space.
