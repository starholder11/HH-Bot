### The Nova Roma Vulnerability
*A Deep Dive into the Technical Details*

#### Origins and Mechanics
The vulnerability in Nova Roma's security infrastructure can be traced back to its inception in 2025 when the development team, the Consilium Sapientiae, created the metaverse. During the design and implementation phase, the team utilized a mapping table that contained geotagged Latin inscriptions placed across the historical city of Rome. This table was sourced from an open-source project spearheaded by the digital classicist community.

The Consilium Sapientiae incorporated these geotagged inscriptions into the metaverse's core structure, using them as unique identifiers for various zones within the virtual city. These identifiers were then linked to the cryptographic keys that control access permissions and governance settings for each zone.

The vulnerability arises from the way these cryptographic keys were generated. The keys were derived from the geotagged Latin inscriptions' GPS coordinates, which were passed through a cipher to create a hash. This hash effectively served as the cryptographic key for the corresponding zone within the metaverse.

#### Exploitation of the Vulnerability
The vulnerability could be exploited by malicious actors who discovered the relationship between the geotagged Latin inscriptions, their GPS coordinates, and the cryptographic keys that control the access permissions and governance settings within Nova Roma. By uncovering a specific Latin inscription's GPS coordinates, an attacker could reverse-engineer the cipher and generate the corresponding cryptographic key.

With the correct cryptographic key in hand, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the permissioning layer of a particular zone within Nova Roma. This would enable them to alter the fundamental physics and rules that govern the zone, potentially causing chaos and disruption.

Since the zones in Nova Roma are hierarchical and nested within one another, a skilled attacker could exploit this vulnerability to change the environment and conditions in progressively larger or smaller areas of the metaverse, depending on the scale of the attack.

This vulnerability was inadvertently introduced by the Consilium Sapientiae when they created Nova Roma, as they failed to anticipate the potential for reverse-engineering the ciphers and gaining unauthorized access to the cryptographic keys. The vulnerability remained undiscovered until the Aventine Cistern Incident in 2033 when the Custodes Aeternitatis exploited it, leading to the rise of the Latin Op Sec movement and the efforts of Scribunta Parka to secure and protect the metaverse.

## Custodes Aeternitatis
The Custodes Aeternitatis, or Guardians of Eternity, are a secretive and enigmatic group operating within the Nova Roma metaverse. Their origins and exact membership remain a mystery, and their motives are not entirely clear. However, it is evident that they possess a deep understanding of the metaverse's inner workings and the Latin language, which they use to exploit the vulnerabilities present in Nova Roma.

Their aims seem to be a complex and multifaceted combination of the following:

1. Power and control: The Custodes Aeternitatis seek to wield influence over the metaverse and its inhabitants by exploiting the Nova Roma Vulnerability. By gaining unauthorized access to the permissioning layer of various zones, they can manipulate the environment and rules to their advantage, effectively establishing themselves as puppet masters behind the scenes.

2. Chaos and disruption: The Custodes Aeternitatis appear to revel in sowing chaos and disorder within the metaverse. Their actions often result in unpredictable and dramatic changes in the environment, leading to confusion and fear among the inhabitants. This chaos may be an end in itself or a means to further their other goals.

3. Eroding trust in the system: The Custodes Aeternitatis may be working to undermine the very foundations of the Nova Roma metaverse by exploiting its vulnerabilities and demonstrating its flaws. This could potentially lead to a loss of trust in the metaverse's governance structures and security measures, pushing users away and opening the door for alternative metaverse platforms to rise in prominence.

4. Pursuit of knowledge and secrets: The Custodes Aeternitatis may be driven by a desire to uncover hidden knowledge and secrets within the metaverse, using their mastery of the Latin language and understanding of the Nova Roma Vulnerability to explore areas and access information otherwise inaccessible to regular users.

The true nature of the Custodes Aeternitatis and their ultimate goals remain shrouded in mystery, but their actions have had a significant impact on the metaverse, leading to the rise of the Latin Op Sec movement and the efforts of Scribunta Parka to protect and secure the metaverse against their incursions.
