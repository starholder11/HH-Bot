Viktor stood three deep in a sluggish line. Ahead of him, a man in hi-vis coveralls debated at length the merits of mentholated toothpicks versus cherry cigarillos. The cashier, a teenager draped in store-branded ennui, showed no signs of urgency. Viktor, holding his lonely pack of spearmint, looked like a man on the verge of declaring war. The line did not so much move forward as it did re-enact the geological formation of sedimentary rock.

He glanced around. An older woman in front of him fumbled with a wallet of coupons, paging through plastic sleeves as if negotiating the fate of nations. Viktor’s eye twitched. He was a man for whom inefficiency was a moral failing, and yet here he was—brought low by a coupon booklet and a ten-dollar minimum on card purchases.

Finally, the conveyor belt groaned. Viktor set down his gum with the deadly precision of a chess master making his final move. The cashier looked up, unfazed. “Paper or plastic?”

“Neither,” Viktor replied, his accent pouring out like cold vodka. “It is a packet of gum. Unless you believe it will vaporize the moment I step outside.”

She blinked, unimpressed. “It’s store policy. I have to ask.”

He considered a retort, decided against it, and simply handed over enough cash to recall the glory days of post-Soviet hyperinflation. The receipt spilled out interminably, enough for a Tolstoy novella. As Viktor reached for his gum, the register jammed.

The world held its breath. Viktor did not. He let out a slow, theatrical sigh that carried the collective disappointment of a thousand failed moonshots. “You know,” he muttered just loud enough for the world (or at least the cashier) to hear, “in certain circles this would constitute a crime against humanity.”

He left without his receipt, chewing aggressively, contemplating whether one could, in fact, send a tactical nuclear response to a gas station. But by the time he reached the parking lot, his annoyance had faded—transmuted, like most things in Viktor’s life, into a story to be told later, in a better-lit room, and preferably with better company.
