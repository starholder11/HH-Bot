*Mags “Noiseheart” Ferro*

**Years Alive:** 2038–? (rumored alive, persists as myth and data-blur)

**Home:** Sprawl around the outlaw districts of “Wetline,” the interstitial zone running from the hurricane-cracked edges of Miami through drowned Everglades up to patched-over tech enclaves in the dead grid north.

Mags was shaped by collapse, not by collective healing. Her parents were “claimjumpers”—freelance demolitionists who squatted in Data Black Zones, selling bare metal and banned drives to ghost markets. Mags grew up rewiring scrapyard bots, not to help anyone but to survive, entertain, and outwit every low-level AI slogging data for law enforcement, insurance, or basic services. She cut her teeth programming “clatter clowns”—virus-ghosts that hijacked street advertisements and giggled nonsense at feds and would-be saviors alike.  By her late teens, her name was already whispered in the Quorum channels, but even there, she was referred to as a liability—a walking glitch. “Noiseheart” didn’t crusade for justice or mutual aid. She sabotaged committee drones, spiked food printer queues to generate rolling bars of raw cornmeal, and ran “circuit parties” for other outliers: wild, illegal festivals that lasted until rival gangs or boundary-pushing AIs crashed the scene.  Unlike the canon rebels or movement-builders, Mags rejected all banners. She openly mocked the Quorum anarchists and their Chaos as Praxis treatises, calling them “thesis cultists waiting for someone to put them on a coin.” She had partners, never followers, and even those would vanish—sometimes after a botched heist, sometimes by her own hand, when trust felt too close to a leash.  There is no redemption arc for Mags Ferro in the history books. She chased the myth of “pure interruption”—flipping the board whenever anyone got too comfortable, too hopeful, or too resigned. Her most famous act was plunging three distinct reality nodes into a looping feedback mirage during an Imperium input census, leaving everyone from census-takers to local racketeers believing for two days that the sun had reversed direction and that the “State of Liberty” had declared Miami a sovereign monarchy.  Nobody in the timeline claims her as a hero, only as a persistent, necessary irritant. Some say she ended up absorbed into the backbone of a wandering AI archipelago; others claim she built a stronghold in the Wetline wetlands, where abandoned simulation rigs flash with ghost noise all night. In Starholder’s ever-fracturing reality, you might glimpse her handiwork any time your feeds or senses start blinking—static, signal loss, a fever-dream voice urging you to “Wake up! Flip the coin! Noise is proof you’re not alone.”  Everything above pulls from the actual friction and texture at the timeline’s fringe, especially the ethos of the Quorum, the mythologized outlaws, and the critique of consensus and control. Mags is not meant as a paragon but as a reflection of that “fringe as center” spirit that Starholder canon itself spotlights: real change and real weirdness erupts most where everyone wants to smooth things out.
