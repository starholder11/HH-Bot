## The Year In Review:
The year 2078 in the Starholder timeline marked a critical juncture in the ongoing Second Moon saga, defined by increased activity and startling revelations from the lunar colonies. This year, which commences the Third Phase of the Second Moon Event, unfolds with intensifying interactions and escalating tensions between Earth and the enigmatic celestial entity.

The expansion of lunar colonies into two additional craters signifies not just physical growth but also a deepening commitment to understanding and exploiting the resources of the Second Moon. This expansion is accompanied by a surge in activities that includes erratic energy bursts—phenomena that puzzle and alarm scientists back on Earth. These bursts are not only powerful and unpredictable but also hint at the underlying capabilities and perhaps intentions of the alien artifact, raising questions about the nature of the entity and its technology.

Amidst these developments, the year is further complicated by human actions. Acts of energy piracy become more frequent as individuals and groups from Earth attempt to harness the unexplained yet potent energy emanations from the Second Moon for their own use. These audacious efforts, driven by both desperation and opportunity, underscore the growing lawlessness and opportunism on the lunar front, reflecting the breakdown of traditional regulations and controls in the face of such unprecedented circumstances.

The most shocking revelation of 2078, however, revolves around the alien entity itself. New insights suggest that the Second Moon might be more than just a passive observatory or a relic. It appears to be a sophisticated, active participant in the cosmic arena, capable of influencing events and environments on the Moon and beyond. This revelation shifts the narrative significantly, positioning the Second Moon not merely as an object of study or a resource to be exploited, but potentially as a formidable player in the solar system with its own agenda.

These revelations and activities contribute to a rapidly evolving situation that strains political, scientific, and social resources. International collaborations and conflicts intensify as nations and corporations vie to understand and influence the outcomes of these interactions. The public's perception of the Second Moon shifts from curiosity and concern to trepidation and awe, influencing cultural expressions, policy decisions, and global discourse.

As 2078 comes to a close, the trajectory for the following year is set towards further exploration, engagement, and possibly confrontation with the Second Moon. The implications of its activities and the true nature of its intentions remain unclear, fostering a climate of uncertainty and anticipation. The stage is set for a continued deepening of the human-alien dynamic, promising profound implications for humanity's understanding of their place in the cosmos and the future of their interstellar relationships.‍‍‍
