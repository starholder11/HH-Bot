\*\*Hymn of the Liminal Star: For Alaric the Navigator\*\*  \*Verse 1\*   Beneath the arch of fractal light,   We gather, seeking guidance old and new.   Alaric, watcher on the edge of night,   Guide us as we wander through.    \*Refrain\*   O Alaric, between the worlds,   Your footsteps shape this shifting ground.   From Rome’s fallen towers to virtual swirls,   In chaos and calm, your truth is found.    \*Verse 2\*   Once a shadow, neither foe nor friend,   A walker in the thorny gray.   You taught us how all borders bend,   And found the dawn in ruins’ sway.    \*Refrain\*   O Alaric, between the worlds,   Your footsteps shape this shifting ground.   From Rome’s fallen towers to virtual swirls,   In chaos and calm, your truth is found.    \*Bridge\*   Mentor of change, harbinger bright,   We chant your name in code and rhyme.   Guardian fractal in digital night,   Bless our path through tangled time.    \*Final Refrain\*   O Alaric, between the worlds,   With wisdom wreathed in dusk and dawn,   Let the liminal song be unfurled—   Guide us ever, till night is gone.
