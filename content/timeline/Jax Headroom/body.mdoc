Let me introduce you to **Jax “Headroom” Stone**, a quintessential liminal engineer of the Starholder era. He's a person whose very existence is wrapped in that dance between states, realities, and selves.  Jax Stone, who’s known as “Headroom” to all who work the interstices with him, is widely respected for his brilliant but often iconoclastic approach to transitional space. If you ever meet him in person—or, more likely, encounter his multi-sensory presence in a pocket reality or at an emergent digital-rustic crossroads—you’ll first be struck by the restless glint in his eyes, like someone who’s always running calculations just behind the casual smile.

Born in a turbulent “dusk node” community in northern Scandinavia, Jax spent his formative years among wild landscapes, patchy broadband, and experimental kin families. He learned early how to improvise interfaces between the old world and the new, whether that meant patching legacy solar systems into communal food servers, or—his later obsession—crafting personal “transit zones” where digital and physical layers pulse and mingle.  Jax carved out a place among the liminal engineers during the crucial period known as the Great Disruption. That was an era when reality itself seemed to fragment, as digital, augmented, and even wholly synthetic realms collided and merged. Liminal engineers had become the “architects of complex systems that mediate between these different states of existence.” Stone distinguished himself by creating resonant interfaces—neither fully digital nor physical—that allowed entire communities to coexist across boundaries, grafting old traditions onto wild new architectures.

His handle “Headroom” comes from his fabled knack for finding “spare space” in places where everyone else saw constriction—those little gaps where adaptability, improvisation, and possibility dwell. Give Jax a sensor overload, a paradoxical routing error, or a metaphysical puzzle about identity and place, and he’ll grin and dive straight in. He’s known to mutter, “If you’re not stumbling, you’re not exploring,” a line that’s become something of a mantra across liminal engineering circles.  Jax runs IntersticeOS like a cathedral-organist, fingers on fractal keys, orchestrating pocket realities while debating the philosophy of existence with his trusty AI mentor, Virtual Alaric. He thrives on the ritualistic, almost mystical aspects of the job—reciting poetic code, conducting algorithmic pageantry with his team, and blending technology, philosophy, and art into something greater.

Jax’s reputation is paradoxical. He’s a guardian and a trickster, renowned for championing ethical stewardship of pocket realities, but equally loved for spurring irreverent experiments in liminality that unsettle the status quo. Some say he is haunted by the question, “What does anyone do in a world that refuses to be a world?”—and rather than solve it, he’s determined to live its contradictions out loud.  A tall figure with perpetual bedhead, a predilection for layered wool and walnut interfaces, and an expressive way of moving through any environment, Jax “Headroom” Stone embodies the liminal engineer’s beat: one foot in the tangible, one foot in the hyperreal, and both arms flung wide to greet whatever is waiting in the in-between.  If you want a glimpse into Jax’s daily world, just watch for the digital auroras flickering through the northern dusk. Chances are, Headroom’s out there, tuning the next layer, invoking strategy from a pocket mentor, and weaving meaning where others see only flux.\
