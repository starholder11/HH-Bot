At PearlExcess, every menu is a living thing, just like its oysters. You sit down and you’re given not just a plate but a story, layered with tributes to Alexander Davies’ journey from disgrace to oyster-fueled rebirth. Here’s how I’d spin tonight’s special menu, with a wink toward his legend and the perennial themes from the Modern Oyster Age.  \*\*PearlExcess Tasting Flight: The Five-Stage Redemption\*\*  To start, each diner is presented with a map scored by briny drops, charting the arc from disaster to transcendence:  1. \*\*The Beausoleil Bolt\*\*      From New Brunswick, launched on Davies’ conversion day. Served on a bed of laser-etched glass, dusted with freeze-dried horseradish pearls. Accompanied by a note: "Every fall is a prelude to clarity."  2. \*\*The Mirage Market\*\*      A rare Persian Gulf oyster. Topped with gold-flecked preserved lemon foam and “liquid asset” mignonette. Guests debate whether its murky depth signals risk or reward.  3. \*\*The Shucked Short\*\*      A lean Atlantic Duxbury, peated whisky caviar on top. Each mouthful comes with a recap of Davies’ brush with regulatory ruin and the resulting vow: “Let nothing go unexamined.”  4. \*\*Mother Oyster’s Alchemy\*\*      The chef’s proprietary blend—mixture of classic French and Thai oyster. Dressed with yuzu kosho and wild sea asparagus, this bite is the moment transformation sparks in the soul: “Adapt, endure, convert trouble to treasure.”  5. \*\*Transcendent Closure\*\*      Rare Kumamoto, flash-smoked, served under a bell jar. When revealed, a mist of sea and citrus escapes. A fortune is inscribed beneath the shell, as Davies would say, “Your tomorrow is inside this shell.”  \*\*The PearlPairing Program\*\*  Guests can “invest” in a unique wine, sake, and spirit portfolio, each selected to track the risk-reward flavor journey. Sommelier bots offer speculative pairings—some safe, some wild. One in ten thrift-pour selections contains a “shell-shock” rare bottle hidden behind a QR code, rewarding the curious.  \*\*Digital Shell Games\*\*  On the side, AR overlays let diners wager micro-credits on which oyster holds the “pearl of insight” for the evening. Winners receive a rare ceramic sake cup, hand-painted with a Davies quote.  \*\*Dessert: Burnt Sugar Grit & Pearl Gelato\*\*  House-made gelato flecked with edible pearls. The burn of the sugar is a tongue-in-cheek homage to Davies’ old hedge fund enemies.  That’s the spirit of PearlExcess—unpredictable, theatrical, always on the cusp between reckoning and rebirth. Of course, the menu claims to be ever-changing, much like the tides shaping the oysters’ world. Would you like a special feature for a private table, or perhaps a secret dish known only to the insiders? Just say the word.
