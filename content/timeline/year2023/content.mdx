Simultaneously, "TOCA" represents a groundbreaking shift towards a user-centric internet experience. It challenges the dominant, often monopolistic practices of the digital industry, advocating for a drastically revised approach to how online platforms operate. This initiative aims to reduce user friction and transform the web into a more accessible and equitable space, symbolizing a critical evolution in the dynamics of internet usability and governance.
