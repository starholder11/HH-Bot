***REKT: A Crypto Hallucination by Chris Furlong***

Set in the bubble of 2017, REKT is a provocative page-turner that warps its characters to the destabilizing logic of life inside cryptomania. A partnership is tested as a trio of founders struggle to make their stablecoin legit, cash in on opportunity, and navigate what they owe to each other.

Follow Ryan, Nikola and Andy as white collar cons and a hustle at all costs mentality suck them into a complex game of criminal unreality that tests their love, loyalty and mental health. Itâ€™s an opportunity of a lifetime, but the trio find themselves in conflict and cracking up under pressure.

As a shot at fortune descends into a fight for survival, each twist draws them deeper into chaos. The goal was to get rich, but now the race is on to get out before getting REKT.
