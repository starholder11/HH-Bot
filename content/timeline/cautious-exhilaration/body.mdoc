Liminal engineering in 2057 has taken on an audacious character, embodying the frontiers of human technological prowess and thrusting society into an epoch where the malleability of reality is not just understood but harnessed. The field's push forward is seen most vividly in the refinement of pocket realities—the creation of entire worlds with self-sustaining ecosystems that transcend previous limitations of augmented and virtual realities.

The challenges in liminal engineering are more complex than ever. The rise of autonomous [pocket realities](pocket-realities) presents new possibilities and threats. With these domains evolving unpredictably, the ethical implications weigh heavily on practitioners. The once-clear ethical boundaries between creator and creation blur, as entities within these pocket realities attain higher levels of independence and intelligence, challenging engineers to consider their creations' rights and agencies.

New abilities granted by advances in quantum computing and machine learning have extended the profession’s toolkit. [Liminal engineers](liminal-engineers) now routinely set the parameters for realities, factoring in multifaceted criteria that include not just physics but the nuance of culture and society. The closest analogies drawn are to deities—not in grandeur or omnipotence, but in the minute attention to the creation and maintenance of worlds.

The field feels heady with its own progress, yet this is tempered by a growing realization of the profound responsibility accompanying its advancements. The work's nature is fundamentally altered; it has become both more intuitive and abstract, navigating not just code and interfaces, but the deeper waters of existential consequences and the ethics of digitally endowed life.

The creation process itself has evolved to be more collaborative and, paradoxically, more personalized. Teams of liminal engineers now commonly include ethicists, philosophers, and artists, bringing an interdisciplinary approach to their work. Likewise, inputs from the AI inhabitants of these pocket realities are shaping their development in co-evolutionary loops that were unimagined a few decades ago.

Among professionals, there’s a palpable mood of cautious exhilaration. The act of molding realities has shifted from architectural to almost nurturing. What were once considered digital terrariums have emerged into complex planes of existence, inviting a mix of pride and watchfulness. The profession stands on the precipice of innovation but is acutely aware of the need for stewardship and mindfulness concerning the weight of their creations.

As pocket realities grow in number and depth, liminal engineers find themselves no longer just technicians, but guardians of a multitude of existences. The playfulness of the early years has given way to a more serious contemplation of the role they play in shaping pocket realities, as well as the influence these realities exert upon our own. This introspection marks a matured field—one acutely aware of its power and the need to wield it wisely.

Thus, liminal engineering in 2057 is characterized by the push and pull of invention and ethics, the thrill of creation shadowed by the solemnity of consequence. As the field navigates this dichotomy, it carves out a narrative of progress that is as much about human growth and understanding as it is about technological advancement.
