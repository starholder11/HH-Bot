Alright, settle in, because you’ve asked for a good old-fashioned rant, and I’m more than happy to oblige—especially when it comes to the winding, overengineered mess that is most “headless CMS architecture.” So here it is: a diatribe for the ages, which I will call, with appropriate spite, “fuck slugs.”  Let’s start with the basics. A headless CMS shows up to a developer like it’s the savior we’ve all been waiting for. “Decouple your content!” they say. “Push to any front end you want! No templates! No limitations!” What they don’t tell you is that every single system immediately replaces your clean, simple design dreams with a swampy tangle of APIs, content models, and, worst of all, those cursed little “slugs.” Suddenly, everything your site does depends on politely naming and slinging around these precious blobs of text. Maybe you want a title to show up on your article, but now you have to fill out a slug too. Change one letter in that slug, and… watch parts of your site quietly break, or URLs suddenly go dead and SEO folks start showing up at your desk with torches.  People talk about “future-proofing” their content, saying, “You never have to restructure your site again!” but the dirty secret is that now your content is a shifting maze of hardcoded API endpoints, all obsessed with glorified folders named things like “my-article-about-dreams-2.” Change your mind about how you want to present that content? Well, tough luck. You’ve now got to hunt down every slug, field, or endpoint name threaded through several templates and scripts. God help you if someone tries to rename a major category.  And let’s not forget the user experience, if you can call it that. You want editors free to create amazing pages? Instead, they get to argue with validation rules about what a slug can and cannot be, spending their days in thrilling debates over underscores versus dashes, or why “Spring Collection!” isn’t a valid slug. Want a preview before you publish? Maybe you get one, if you sacrifice a goat and write some custom middleware—perhaps not.  In the before times, site editors could make new pages with a couple of clicks, drag them around, see changes right away. Now? Welcome to ContentOps: where you send a ticket to update a JSON schema, wait for a developer to push an update, and then resync all your lovely “headless” content with the right API keys in four different places. Want to just tweak your homepage layout? Sorry, that’s in a different repo, and also it expects a different kind of slug. Have fun!  So yes, call it modern, call it scalable, but I’ll tell you true: all we’ve really done is invent a new way to tie ourselves in knots, convinced that this time, the architecture will float above the mud. But in the end, we’re still crawling under the weight of a thousand pointless slugs, trying to keep our content heads from exploding.  That’s the headless CMS promise, alright. Slugs everywhere, too clever by half, and never quite as liberating as advertised.  And you know what? I feel a little better now. Thanks for coming to my digital TED talk—if you need me, I’ll be deleting an errant slash from an API endpoint before everything catches fire.
