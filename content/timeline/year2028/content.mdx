## The Year In Review:
In 2028, the Starholder timeline expands its discourse into novel realms of digital existentialism, intricate metaverse dynamics, and autonomous corporate governance, each narrative branch weaving complex threads through the fabric of this increasingly interconnected world.

The narrative around "**Local Jealousy**" paints a vivid picture of personal connections grounded in the real world, set against the backdrop of a spatially and socially stratified Queens, New York. The story underscores the nuanced interplay of personal histories and contemporary challenges, focusing on two old friends reflecting on their journeys through the ups and downs of life, symbolizing the broad theme of personal relationships persisting amid societal shifts.

Simultaneously, the metaverse scenario presented in "**Dreamweapon**" introduces a mystical and chaotic quest within the BLIV metaverse. The Dark Dreamers, a sect within this digital universe, embark on an elusive mission to assemble the Dreamweapon. This powerful tool promises the ability to unlock and reconstruct historical and relational contexts from digital fragments, representing a profound exploration of how digital and historical realities might intermingle, affecting perceptions and power structures within the metaverse.

Furthermore, the emergence of "**Autonomous Corporations**", recognized officially in 2028, marks a pivotal shift in the economic and operational paradigms of businesses. These AI-driven entities, operating independently of human oversight, redefine traditional notions of control, decision-making, and market interactions. The narrative discusses their profound impact on global economic landscapes, legal frameworks, ethical considerations, and the potential reshaping of corporate governance.

These three diverse yet interconnected narratives from 2028 showcase a year where digital and physical realms increasingly converge, challenging existing paradigms and inviting deeper reflections on identity, agency, and power. The stories reflect a world grappling with the implications of these changesâ€”both the potential enhancements they bring to personal and economic interactions, and the risks they pose to established societal norms and individual autonomy.

Overall, 2028 in Starholder is characterized by rich narrative explorations that delve into the heart of digital transformation's impact on human experiences, societal structures, and historical understanding. Each storyline unfolds against the broader backdrop of a world navigating through the intricate challenges and opportunities posed by revolutionary technological evolutions and their profound effects on human life and global systems.
