### Overview
The Global Water Crisis of 2034, occurring between March and November of that year, marked an unforeseen catastrophe that engulfed numerous cities worldwide, leading to water rationing, economic strain, and social unrest. Los Angeles, Cairo, and Mumbai became emblematic of the crisis, experiencing water shortages unparalleled in modern history.

### Causes
#### Climate Anomalies
Unusually severe droughts struck key water basins. The Nile Basin experienced a 40% reduction in rainfall, while the Colorado River Basin saw its driest year in a century. Glaciers in the Himalayas, vital for Mumbai's water supply, retreated at an accelerated pace.

#### Infrastructure Breakdown
On May 12, 2034, Los Angeles' primary water treatment facility suffered a catastrophic failure, leaving 4 million residents without access to clean water. Cairo's Qanater Water Complex experienced similar issues, with a 30% reduction in treatment capacity due to outdated machinery.

#### Rapid Urbanization
Mumbai's population surged to over 22 million by 2034, with an influx of 2 million people in just five years, exacerbating the city's water supply challenges.

#### Mismanagement and Corruption
Investigations revealed that Cairo's water authorities misallocated $500 million intended for water infrastructure over the preceding decade, contributing to the crisis.

### Impact
#### Humanitarian Crisis
An estimated 15 million people were directly affected by water rationing across the impacted cities. In Cairo, waterborne diseases such as cholera claimed over 2,000 lives.

#### Economic Fallout
Los Angeles' agricultural sector lost $3 billion in revenue due to irrigation shortages. Mumbai's textile industry, heavily reliant on water, saw a 25% decrease in production, leading to job losses for 100,000 workers.

### Social Unrest
In Cairo, a series of protests known as the "Water Marches" involved over 300,000 citizens demanding governmental accountability. The Mumbai Water Riots of August 2034 resulted in 17 deaths and 200 arrests.

#### Policy Shifts
The U.S. Congress allocated $10 billion for emergency water infrastructure repair, while Egypt initiated a five-year plan to revitalize the Nile Delta's water management system.

### Legacy
The Global Water Crisis of 2034 became a focal point for international debate on water security. The subsequent "Geneva Water Pact" was signed by 60 countries, pledging to invest in sustainable water management and share technological advancements. The event also spurred the creation of the International Water Security Agency (IWSA), headquartered in Geneva, to monitor and respond to global water threats.

### Case Studies
**Los Angeles:** Implementation of stringent water-saving measures, including the "50 Gallon Challenge," limiting residents to 50 gallons of water per day. **Cairo:** Launch of the "Nile Revival Project," a $2 billion initiative to modernize water treatment facilities and improve irrigation. **Mumbai:** Creation of the "Mumbai Water Council," engaging citizens, corporations, and government in cooperative water management strategies.
