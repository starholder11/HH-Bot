## Physical Characteristics and Location of the Second Moon
### Size
The Second Moon is a celestial body approximately one-quarter the size of Earth's moon. Measurements obtained through space and ground-based telescopes have estimated its diameter to be roughly 865 miles (1,392 kilometers), making it significantly larger than Pluto but smaller than Earth's Moon.

### Location and Lunar Orbit
The Second Moon occupies a unique orbital path that shadows Earth's Moon. It consistently positions itself in such a way that it remains 'hidden' behind our Moon from the perspective of Earth. This intriguing behavior has led to much speculation about the force or intelligence guiding its movements, as this 'shadowing' of the lunar orbit is seemingly deliberate and does not conform to the gravitational dynamics that govern natural satellites.

### Elemental Composition
While the exact elemental composition of the Second Moon remains unclear, preliminary studies suggest that its outer shell is largely composed of plasma. There are a few leading theories regarding the specifics of this plasma composition:

1. **Exotic Matter Theory:** This theory suggests the presence of unknown or exotic matter. Given the shell's unusual properties, such as its impenetrability to known sensor technologies, some scientists propose that the plasma may contain particles not currently documented in the standard model of particle physics.

2. **Heavy Element Plasma Theory:** Another theory posits that the plasma shell consists of ultra-dense heavy elements not commonly found on Earth. This could potentially explain the shell's resilience and resistance to sensor penetration.

3. **Quantum Plasma Theory:** This theory, arguably the most controversial, suggests that the plasma shell might exhibit quantum properties. This could potentially account for its seemingly impenetrable nature and its resistance to conventional forms of analysis.

Despite rigorous examination and debate, a consensus on the elemental composition of the Second Moon's plasma shell has yet to be reached, adding to the celestial body's enigmatic nature.
