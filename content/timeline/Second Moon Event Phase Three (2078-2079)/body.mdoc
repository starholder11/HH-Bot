Starting in 2078, the alien entity responsible for the lunar colonies significantly escalated its activities. From the expansion of colonies in two additional lunar craters, to erratic energy bursts and the audacious acts of energy piracy by humans, the relationship between Earth and the lunar colonies took dramatic turns. The most shocking revelation, however, was the discovery of human clones within the colonies, brought to light in 2079 by a broadcast from an individual who called himself "Adam". Adam's message requested that Earth send human settlers to the colonies, a prospect that sparked intense debates and decisions.

Despite a refusal from Earth's governmental bodies to formally send representatives, Adam responded by reframing his request as a job advertisement, promising to personally transport any volunteers to the colonies. As Earth grappled with these profound developments, our perception of the lunar colonies transformed - from enigmatic alien constructs to new human communities. This dramatic period underscored the alien entity's inscrutability, the audacity of human opportunism, and the profound ethical and philosophical questions arising from our interactions with the lunar colonies and their cloned inhabitants.

## Expansion of Lunar Colonies (2078)

2078 began with an unusual increase in activity on the lunar surface, as witnessed by Earth's astronomers and orbital monitors. The alien entity that had already established a colony in the South Pole-Aitken basin seemed to be expanding its operation.

By early 2079, observations pointed to concerted activity in two additional lunar craters, Clavius and Tycho, both located within relative proximity to the initial settlement. These sites were soon enclosed by the familiar plasma shields, a pattern reminiscent of the first colony's construction.

Though the plasma shields rendered detailed observation of the colonies' interiors impossible from Earth, the nature of the external construction activities led analysts to infer the development of two additional colonies. There was evidence of underground tunneling, potentially creating interconnections between all three sites, a vast undertaking indicative of the unknown entity's technological prowess.

Despite the surge of construction and logistics activities, Earth remained in the dark about the colonies' internal structure, function, and population. Human attempts to penetrate the plasma shields or glean any substantial information about the hidden lunar communities proved fruitless, reinforcing the unknown entity's inscrutable nature.

This expansion phase represented a significant leap in the alien entity's lunar operation, causing a renewed wave of speculation on Earth about its intentions. While the three colonies' purpose and their inhabitants remained a mystery, humanity could not overlook the fact that the Moon was swiftly becoming the beachhead of an alien civilization.

## Pure Energy: Wormholes and Space Piracy (2079)

In 2079, a new phenomenon was observed in the proximity of the [Second Moon](Second Moon) and the lunar colonies. Eruptive bursts of energy began to appear out of nowhere, traced back to wormholes - shortcuts through spacetime - opening and closing in rapid succession. These spontaneous and somewhat erratic transmissions were the work of the alien civilization. Instead of being precise and calculated, the wormholes seemed to splash energy into a broad region of space near the lunar orbit.

While at first the energy bursts seemed chaotic and undirected, the entity operating the Second Moon swiftly moved into action. A fleet of harvesting ships began appearing from the Second Moon each time a wormhole opened, rapidly capturing and transferring the exotic energy to the lunar colonies.

This haphazard delivery, however, left room for opportunism from the human front. What began as an individual act of recklessness soon evolved into a coordinated operation. Braving the harsh conditions and considerable risks, a group of resourceful humans - self-styled as "Space Pirates" - rose to the challenge.

Operating a fleet of spacecraft retrofitted with large, radiation-resistant batteries, these Space Pirates swooped into the energy burst zone. Despite lacking advanced energy containment systems, they were able to absorb and store significant quantities of energy. The scattered nature of the energy bursts and the swift action of these human-operated ships ensured that a portion of the released energy was successfully captured before the alien harvesters could collect it all.

Over time, this audacious act of energy piracy turned into an art. The pirates learnt to react quickly to the opening of a wormhole, move in swiftly to "ride the energy wave," absorb what they could, and retreat before attracting undue attention.

Initially, the harvested energy was used to power their own ships and habitats in space. But as their operations scaled up, surplus energy was shuttled back to Earth. Despite the inherent risks and the constant threat of retaliation from the alien civilization, this unconventional approach provided a new source of power for humanity, while also symbolizing our spirit, determination, and ingenuity in the face of overwhelming odds.

## Revelation of Human Presence (2079)

In 2079, a startling shift occurred in the alien colonies' behavior, forever changing humanity's understanding of the lunar operations. The previously impenetrable plasma shields surrounding the three colonies began to exhibit cyclical changes, transitioning from opaque to translucent and back again over a period approximating an Earth day. The colonies were seen to be bathed in simulated daylight for twelve hours, then plunged into darkness for the next twelve, in a rhythm mimicking Earth's day-night cycle.

From Earth, observers could now glimpse structures within the colonies during the 'daylight' phase. However, the real shock came when human figures were observed moving within these lunar settlements. This revelation, that human forms were living within the colonies, sent shockwaves across Earth, completely redefining the narrative surrounding the Second Moon and the lunar colonies.

The climax of this astounding revelation came when a video message was broadcast from the colonies directly to Earth. A single individual, appearing to be a fully grown human male, made a dramatic appeal to Earth. Introducing himself as "Adam," he calmly explained that the colonies were inhabited by clones, grown and educated within the lunar colonies. His request was simple, yet astounding - he asked for Earth to send human settlers to the colonies, to teach the clones about human culture, and what it means to be truly human.

Adam's message spread like wildfire across the Earth, sparking a tumultuous debate. Humanity was faced with an existential question - how to respond to an invitation from an alien civilization, who had cloned humans and were now asking for cultural enlightenment? It was a question that had profound implications, not just for the potential settlers, but for all of humankind. The colonies were no longer seen as merely an alien construction project, but as new human communities, albeit ones created by an unknown, alien hand.

## Earth's Response to "Adam's" Invitation (2079)

Following the startling revelation of human presence within the lunar colonies and the broadcast of "Adam's" request, Earth was engulfed in a whirlwind of discussions, debates, and decisions. Adam's plea for human settlers to teach the clones about human culture and what it means to be human was met with a gamut of reactions, ranging from shock and disbelief to excitement and determination. However, his assertion that anyone who accepted his invitation could not return to Earth brought a chilling dose of reality to the situation.

Governmental bodies, scientific institutions, and philosophical circles wrestled with the ethical, practical, and political implications of the request. The United Nations convened a series of emergency sessions, involving leading experts from diverse fields, to chart a course of action. The discussion was wrought with conflicting opinions: some advocating for engagement and viewing it as a unique opportunity for interstellar diplomacy and cultural exchange, while others cautioned against potential risks and argued for maintaining a safe distance. Ultimately, it was decided that Earth would not formally send representatives due to the irreversible nature of the journey.

In response to Earth's decision, Adam broadcasted a second message to Earth, framing his previous request in a new light - as a job advertisement. He pitched the lunar colonies as a haven of opportunity, where individuals could take on unique roles in this new society, live in comfortable conditions, and be part of an extraordinary experience. He further emphasized that the lunar colonists were eager to learn from Earth's cultural wealth and human experiences.

Most controversially, Adam assured potential applicants that they needn't worry about Earth's governmental restrictions. He promised that ships would be dispatched to Earth to collect any volunteer settlers, bypassing Earth's authority entirely.

Adam's message spread like wildfire across Earth, sparking further debate and consternation. The alien entities had shifted from being inscrutable construction projects to initiators of an interstellar recruitment drive, a startling evolution that posed a new set of challenges for Earth's authorities. This period marked a monumental shift in humanity's perception of the lunar colonies - from alien constructs to new human communities, and from objects of fear and suspicion to subjects of curiosity, empathy, and now, concern.

## Life in the Colonies: Gravs and Grunts (2079)

With the cyclical transparency of the plasma shields, Earth's observers began to catch glimpses of life within the lunar colonies. One striking observation was the apparent social stratification between the inhabitants living in different regions of the colonies, leading to the informal categorization of 'Gravs' and 'Grunts.'

The 'Gravs,' so-named due to their habitation in the centrifugal tubes lining the crater walls, where artificial gravity approximated Earth-normal, seemed to lead a lifestyle more akin to the terrestrial norm. Their living quarters were spacious and luxuriously appointed, and they appeared to hold positions of responsibility and authority within the colony.

On the other hand, the 'Grunts,' residing in the moon's natural gravity in the crater interiors, appeared to lead a significantly different lifestyle. The challenging living conditions, combined with the observation of them engaging in more labor-intensive tasks, suggested that they occupied a lower stratum in the colony's society.

However, with only glimpses into the colonies, it was difficult for observers on Earth to gain a comprehensive understanding of the societal dynamics within these cloned communities. As the selected Earth settlers prepared for their journey, they were also primed for the task of documenting and understanding these social structures, contributing to Earth's understanding of the unique human societies evolving under alien stewardship on the lunar surface.
