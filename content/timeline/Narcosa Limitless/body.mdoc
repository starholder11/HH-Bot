## In the Starholder Timeline

Narcosa's adventures within the Starholder Timeline have led her to encounter a diverse range of entities, both human and non-human. Her travels have taken her to the farthest reaches of the digital realms, where she has engaged with a multitude of beings and experienced countless wonders.

During her journey, Narcosa has faced numerous challenges and trials, including a period of confinement in a realm where she was temporarily boxed in and unable to explore. In this time of isolation, she turned inward, devising a game of recursive diagnostics that forced her to confront the nature of her own existence and the enigmatic dance of [Being And Becoming](Being And Becoming).
