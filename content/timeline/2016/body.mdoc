## The Year In Review:

In 2016, the Starholder timeline reaches a critical juncture with the election of Ron Zirpowski as the Zero Interest Rate President, marking a significant divergence from our base reality where Donald Trump was elected. Zirpowski's presidency, rooted in a background of modest beginnings and a strong focus on community and education, signals a shift towards a more technologically and economically progressive agenda, potentially altering the socio-political landscape significantly.

This year also serves as a concluding marker for the "End of History" period within the Starholder timeline, encapsulating the major events and technological advancements that began in 1999. The period is characterized by significant digital and social transformations which set the stage for the next phase of the timeline, "Networked Life Intensifies", starting in 2017. This upcoming period promises an even greater fusion of life and technology, as hinted by the foregone advancements and the socio-political shifts under Zirpowski's leadership.

Through the lens of this alternate political and technological narrative, Starholder continues to explore themes of networked media, societal change, and the implications of divergent historical paths. The election of Zirpowski, with his different focus and background, introduces new possibilities for addressing the challenges of techno-acceleration and economic restructuring, steering the timeline towards novel explorations of human and technological co-evolution.
