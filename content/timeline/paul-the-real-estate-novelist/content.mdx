\## Overview  Paul Agosti, known among locals and regulars as “the Real Estate Novelist,” is an emblematic figure in New Artemis’s literary and property scenes circa 2045–2065. Son of a mid-century community developer, Paul rose to modest prominence through his work chronicling the waves of housing evolution in the urban arcologies and modular neighborhoods of the post-Automation Period. While never reaching the mainstream success he once imagined, he is celebrated as a passionate fixer of stories and a beloved, if slightly melancholic, presence in the city’s cultural afterhours. &#x20;

\## Early Life and Career  Raised on the promise of future cities, Paul entered the real estate world in the late 2010s. His early career tracked with the rapid proliferation of self-upgrading smart homes, where narrative salesmanship briefly surged before being subsumed by AI-driven listings and sensorial walk-throughs. As the nature of “home” changed—with more citizens living in communal pods, floating modules, and climate-adaptive dwellings—Paul’s creative energies shifted toward capturing the soul of place in a world increasingly defined by transience and automation. &#x20;

\## The Unfinished Novel  Paul is best known in creative circles for his never-completed magnum opus, \*Vertical Villagers\*. The novel draws from decades of urban churn, tracing the intersected lives of Cascadian arcology dwellers over two generations of automated prosperity and ecological reckoning. Excerpts, often read aloud during “Refinery Nights” (interactive literary gatherings in the New Artemis East Corridor), became cult favorites and were preserved as fragments in various community archives. &#x20;

\## Later Life and Legacy  By the late 2050s, Paul had largely withdrawn from commercial real estate, focusing instead on teaching and mentoring young narrativists—writers who specialized in blending fact and fiction to capture housing histories lost to redevelopment. His storytelling, at once nostalgic and future-facing, helped build solidarity among residents struggling with dislocation, climate anxieties, and the realities of automation-era economies.  Paul’s life and work remain touchstones for those who believe in the connective power of stories, even as cities grow algorithmic and physical roots fade. While “the real estate novelist” may never have found time for a wife or a finished manuscript, he forged deep connections in the shifting neighborhoods he called home.\
