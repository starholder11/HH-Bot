If you ever woke up in the green smother of Dalat’s reconstructed jungles, shot through with pain and mosquito fever, odds are the first face you’d see was Doc Earley’s—goggled, unshaven, and grinning with a payday bar clamped in one side of their mouth and a lumpy medkit dragging at their hip.  They weren’t born to it. Before conscription, Earley played nurse in one of New Houston’s rougher clinics—the kind of place where Friday payday was codeine day, little orange blisters traded under the battered counter whenever cred chips landed. Out past the city, every hush and siren, every brawl with an overdosed creed-runner or a writhing nano-burn victim, was another notch on their stethoscope.  But ten years in the Starholder Timeline’s brushfires meant the clinics started coming to them. Earley’s jungle surgery took place in sticky canvas tents as rain and sap drummed overhead and patient after patient staggered in with wounds that zipped, tore, or lingered in the gut like regret. Sometimes the machines helped—a borrowed Anslem Devices VR sim ran on a glitchy lens, flickering through guidance on shrapnel extraction while Doc used one hand for real work and the other to swat flies.  Earley spoke three languages badly—one for the brass, one for the weeping privates, one for the ghosts that squeezed in close around the IV lines at dawn. When the shelling paused and supplies actually made it upriver, they’d hold “Codeine Payday” break just outside the triage, letting the rain cool their boots while the sugary-salty peanuts of a melted candy bar mixed with the last hit of grape syrup.  Never quite sober, but never off their game, Earley was a genius with a needle, a whisper of comfort, and a muttered threat to any officer who tried to rush “the process.” They could stitch wounds in the dark, one eye cocked for trouble. Their field notes became informal legend—a half-finished novella called \*Arteries of Mud\*, written on the back of medical wrappers and rationed paper, as much about pain as about living through it.  Off duty, Earley could be found burning late at the edge of camp, copying new VR surgery protocols by moonlight, jaw working through a payday, the taste of codeine always a memory, never quite a cure. The kids whispered that only Earley could laugh through a midnight morphine run, quoting old Terran comedies just to stave off the screamers.  There’s talk Earley rides out of every war zone with a new scar, but the same lucky stethoscope and the same battered photo: a neon Houston pharmacy, a row of hunched backs, a scuzzy dream of paydays that bought a little peace, one week at a time....
