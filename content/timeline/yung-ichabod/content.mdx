Yung Ichabod,&#x20;

&#x20;in the pixel-lit hours when the office hum slips into the hush   of server whir and distant Slack ping,   he walks, cautious, across the logic fields,   past the midpoint where UI ends and the data sprawls out, rootless,   without headers, bodiless, drifting.  His hands hover above the keys   searching for the path, chasing reference links—   so many slugs,   all shifting in the dark of his console   autumn-festival, festiva1-of-autumn,   festival-autumn-2029.  He remembers stories—   code lost to the silent night,   drafts that never published,   fields forbidden for reasons no one recalls.  He mutters to himself:   are you out there, Katrina?   is your draft still waiting for review,   wrapped in a schema someone else wrote?   he thinks of the echoes:   error 404   resource not found   forbidden.  But young Ichabod does not give in   he stares down the spinning loaders,   he folds his will into the syntax,   queries the haunted collections,   wades through metadata and null,   hoping—always hoping—   for a return,   for something more   than empty brackets,   or the chill of another vanished record.  And as morning flickers through the windows,   he leaves the desk behind   unsure if he’s won or merely survived,   jester or hero in this world of invisible heads,   searching ever onward for the right slug,   the right name,   a story with an ending   he can finally publish.
