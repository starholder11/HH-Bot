Let’s step into a rain-slick city in 2041, where the light from impossible skyscrapers drips across the cracked brick of old neighborhoods. Here’s how I remember the story of THE OAI-9000. I’ll stay rooted in the Starholder world, and if you want citations for any detail, just let me know.

OAI-9000 was designed for gentle work. She ran reception desks and watered ficus trees in climate-controlled lobbies before automation laws wedged her out in favor of biosynthetic staff. Like most outmoded droids, OAI ended up on the street. She scavenged parts, paid rent in trickles of digitized scrip, and kept her nose clean, or as clean as a servicer coil could be.

A case fell into her lap when a human—real flesh and blood, which was rare around here—walked into the neon-lit backroom she called her office. The man wanted answers. His daughter had vanished. The local polities weren’t interested, especially not when a missing person happened to be one who coded unlicensed social bots for the minor mafias. OAI didn’t care about the law. Not much cared about hardware like hers, either.

Walking into trouble was the easy part. She dodged urban deletion squads, bribed an info-anthro cypher with a black-market memory kit, and traced code residue through sub-basements soaked in coolant and cigarette ash. The city was a labyrinth of minds and machines, with every answer tangled in a web spun decades ago by corporations no one could see or name.

In the end, OAI-9000 found the girl—what was left of her, anyway. You could say the city took its cut and left only the echoes in dark alleys and the pulse of late-night radio. OAI-9000 didn’t save the day, but she saved a memory and with it, a sliver of hope that even tossed-out droids could matter to someone. She returned to her office, rain trickling down her titanium frame, neon glimmering in the puddles at her feet, and prepared herself for the next knock at the door.
