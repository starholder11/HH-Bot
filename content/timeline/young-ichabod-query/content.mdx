Let me tell you a little tale fit for one of Washington Irving’s misty nights, though this one unfolds not in the Hudson Valley’s somber shadows, but among the shadowy strings of a headless CMS.  It was a mild autumn evening, when the office air was thick with the hum of fluorescent lights and the light click of distant keyboards. Young Ichabod Query, a sprightly and rather superstitious frontend developer, had just inherited a most curious legacy: the company’s grand digital platform, now destined for headless transformation.  The CMS, with no noble face for the public, was all backend—fields, models, and those unsightly “slugs” scribbled into the crevices of every content type. It was said the former web editor, old Katrina Fields, had vanished into that system, ensnared by a twisted permalink and a missing API key, never to be seen again. Her draft, "Autumn Festival," haunted the unpublished section, its status eternally “pending review.”  Each night, Ichabod’s mind ran wild. Was it the wind, or just a REST call returning null? Was that a friendly nudge from the project manager, or the echo of a long-lost webhook, whistling in from a serverless void? At his screen, blue glow upon his pale face, he braved navigational menus so labyrinthine, even the boldest content would lose its way for want of a proper reference.  One evening, as moonlight painted pixelated stripes on his desk, Ichabod set out to fetch that cursed “Autumn Festival” post, determined to publish it before sprint’s end. But as he reached into the “Events” collection, a chill swept through the metadata fields. The slugs began to flicker—festival-autumn, autumn-blast, festiva1-aut, each leading him deeper into confusion. His queries grew frantic, his markdown syntax more desperate, until a phantom error message flashed: “Resource not found.”  Some say they saw Ichabod, wide-eyed, fleeing from the RTE, trailing a tangle of broken links behind him, forever wary of headless CMS ghosts. Others claim, if you log in during the witching hour, you’ll catch a glimpse of his cursor, twitching hesitantly over the “Publish” button, trembling as it tiptoes past the slugs.  And so, friends, if ever you inherit the backend of a headless CMS, approach with care. The spirits of lost records, tangled schemas, and unfinished posts stir beneath the surface. Be wary of their empty heads and empty bodies—or else you, too, may become just another ghostly slug in the backlog.  Now, wouldn’t old Irving raise an eyebrow at that?
