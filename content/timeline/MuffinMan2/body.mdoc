Not the one in the nursery rhyme, but in Starholder.

This guy right here, Ambrose....\

Let me tell you about Ambrose, the muffin man on the lower edge of Halo Park, just at the bend where the streetlights flicker in odd sync with the predictive maintenance schedule. For most folks, Ambrose is a fixture, maybe even a punchline, yet for anyone attuned to the more spectral side of things, his existence tugs at the heart with a strange nostalgia.  Each morning at dawn, Ambrose unlocks the rolling steel shutter to reveal trays of burnished muffins—blackcurrant, banana-chocolate, even a meyer lemon poppyseed that dares the usual crowd. These, he can make. These, he must make. He is, after all, the muffin man, and every day, the odd glow of his neon sign affirms it, even after centuries of municipal decay and substructure flux.  But what most never notice is how the window fogs just so, and how Ambrose stares at the blank spaces between batter splatters on his apron. It isn’t boredom or creative drought that haunts him, but the memory of everything he cannot make.  Ambrose’s loop is stitched with longing and denial. Never will there be a tray of almond marzipan croissants curling in a sunrise droop, nor rows of flaky baklava exhaling rosewater in the evening warmth. The marmalade kouign-amanns, heavy with crisped sugar, exist for Ambrose only in the phantom recipes he mutters to himself as the oven timer ticks past three hundred seconds.  It’s not the lack of skill or supplies; the real weight is the implicit contract his name stitched around him. He will never be Ambrose the pastry monger, the patisserie conjurer, the doughnut dreamer. The city’s registry, even as digitized and playful as it might seem since the Mesh reforms, still recognizes him as “Ambrose, Muffin Man.” That’s the sort of poetic bureaucracy that Starholder City excels at—a haunted echo of categorization, of names that become chains even as they try to brand themselves as traditions.  One rainy afternoon, when the synth-rain is falling so thick the storefront windows ripple with a quantum blur, a regular asks, with the careless cruelty only the regulars possess, “Ever think about making a strudel, Ambrose?”  He smiles. “They won’t let me,” he replies, just whisper-soft, and you cannot tell if he means the regulators, the market, or that persistent, hauntological force that makes a muffin man only ever a muffin man. If you watch closely, you might see the ghost of a cinnamon twist, the shadow of a plum Danish, flickering in the oven’s heat haze—pastries that almost were, but never are.  In Starholder, names linger in the architecture of reality, a low-key haunt that shapes not only what you can make, but who you are allowed to be. Ambrose keeps baking, caught gently between what the city insists and what his hands remember, his counter filling each day with what is permitted, and his dreams forever rising with what is not.  If you’re curious about how the boundaries of identity and bureaucracy play games with fate in this city, just linger one dawn outside Ambrose’s shop. Watch for the ghosts in the glass when he isn’t looking. You might find, for a moment, the possibility of a pastry you have never tasted. And then, just as quickly, it will be gone. Would you like to know more about how names and categories shape destinies in Halo Park or elsewhere in this world? Or shall I spin you another shadowed tale?
