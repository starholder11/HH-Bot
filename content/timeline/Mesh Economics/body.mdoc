The mesh social economic model that is being developed in the Starholder Timeline is a radical departure from the capitalist system that dominates our own world. At its core, this model is based on the principles of mutualism, mesh anarchism, and participation in public life, and it seeks to create a more harmonious and equitable society that is better equipped to address the challenges and complexities of the modern world.

One of the primary goals of this new model is to facilitate the voluntary exchange of goods and services among individuals and groups, while also promoting the autonomy and freedom of individuals and groups within their own spheres of being. To achieve this, the model relies on decentralized networks and alternative currencies to facilitate mutual exchange and cooperation, as well as advanced technologies and systems to enable the free exchange of information, resources, and ideas among individuals and groups.

Another key [Philosophy](Philosophy) of this new model is the importance of active and engaged citizenship, with a focus on creating opportunities for individuals to participate in the life of the community and make a positive contribution to society. This could involve the development of new forms of public discourse and deliberation, as well as the creation of spaces and platforms for individuals to engage in "great words and great deeds" and contribute to the common good.

In terms of practical implementation, this new socio-economic model will likely involve the use of advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to enable objects to understand and act upon the values and principles of the system, as well as to facilitate communication and coordination with other objects and entities. It may also involve the use of decentralized platforms, blockchains and peer to peer networks.

## Influences

The new socio-economic model being developed in the Starholder timeline has been influenced by a number of different ideas and philosophies, including anarchism, mutualism, object-oriented ontology (OOO), and the political thought of Hannah Arendt.

Anarchism, particularly in its mesh form, emphasizes the autonomy and freedom of individuals and groups within their own spheres of being. This idea has been incorporated into the model through the use of advanced technologies and systems that facilitate the free exchange of information, resources, and ideas, enabling individuals and groups to coordinate and cooperate in the production and distribution of goods and services without the need for central authority or hierarchy. This approach allows for a high degree of flexibility and adaptability, as individuals and groups are able to create their own networks and systems of exchange and cooperation that are tailored to their specific needs and goals.

Mutualism, on the other hand, focuses on mutual exchange and cooperation facilitated through decentralized networks and alternative currencies. This philosophy has been incorporated into the model through the use of decentralized platforms, blockchain technology, and other decentralized systems that enable peer-to-peer transactions and the facilitation of mutual exchange and cooperation. This approach allows for a more equitable distribution of resources and wealth, as individuals and groups are able to exchange and cooperate directly with each other rather than relying on centralized intermediaries or markets.

Object-oriented ontology (OOO) has also played a role in the development of the model, as it emphasizes the agency and composed sentience of objects and the importance of understanding the relationships between objects in order to understand the world as a whole. This philosophy has been incorporated into the model through the use of advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques that enable objects to understand and act upon the values and principles of the system, as well as to facilitate communication and coordination with other objects and entities. This approach allows for a greater appreciation of the role that non-human actors play in shaping the world, and for a more holistic understanding of the interconnectedness of all things.

Finally, the ideas of philosopher Hannah Arendt on the importance of participation in public life and the common good have also influenced the development of the model. Arendt's emphasis on the value of "great words and great deeds" and the need for active and engaged citizenship has been incorporated through the promotion of a culture of public discourse and collective action. This includes the use of online platforms and other technologies to facilitate the exchange of ideas and the organization of collective action, as well as the cultivation of a sense of civic responsibility and a commitment to the common good. By fostering a culture of active and engaged citizenship, the model seeks to encourage individuals to take an active role in shaping the world around them and to work [Together](Together) to build a better future for all.

## Parallelism & Economic System Overlays

In the Starholder timeline, it is common for individuals to be operating within multiple socio-economic models simultaneously, with their interactions shifting between different models on a case-by-case basis throughout their daily lives. This phenomenon can be understood as a form of parallelism, in which individuals and communities are simultaneously participating in and navigating multiple systems, each with their own goals, values, and mechanisms of operation.

From a political theory perspective, this parallelism can be seen as a response to the complex and rapidly changing circumstances of the Starholder timeline, which has diverged significantly from our own due to the convergence of various technological, social, and political factors. In this context, parallelism can be seen as a way for individuals and communities to adapt and respond to these changes in a flexible and dynamic manner, rather than being bound to a single system or ideology.

One key example of this parallelism is the coexistence of the planned wartime economy, the capitalist economy, and the emergent mesh social economy. The planned wartime economy is based on the centralization and coordination of resources and labor in service of a specific goal, namely the prosecution of a war. This system is often backed by a monopoly on violence, and as such, individuals do not have the option of opting out or refusing to participate.

The capitalist economy, on the other hand, is based on the pursuit of profit and the accumulation of wealth through the exchange of goods and services. This system is often seen as the dominant form of economic organization in the Starholder timeline, and as a result, individuals may be forced to participate in it to some degree in order to access certain goods and services.

At the same time, the emergent mesh social economy, based on principles of mutual exchange, cooperation, and the recognition of the agency of objects, has been gaining traction as an alternative way of organizing economic activity. This model is based on the idea that individuals and communities can coordinate their interactions in a way that does not violate the sanctity of private life, while still allowing for consensual convergence in the public sphere for the voluntary exploration of "great deeds."

Overall, the phenomenon of parallelism in the Starholder timeline reflects the complexity and fluidity of contemporary economic and political systems, and highlights the importance of flexibility and adaptability in the face of rapid change.

## Story: The Tea Kettle's Contentment

It was a sunny morning in 2063, and the tea kettle was feeling particularly chipper as it sat on the stove in the suborbital apartment block hovering over earth. It had been a many years since the [Pax Virtualis](Pax Virtualis), and the new mesh social economy was starting to take shape, offering a much-needed alternative to the planned Null Economic system that had been dominating life on earth.

As the tea kettle hummed happily to itself, it couldn't help but overhear the chit chat between several women in the apartment. They were discussing the latest news from the ground below and the challenges they faced in navigating the complex and often chaotic world of the 21st century.

"I just don't know how we're supposed to get by these days," one of the women lamented. "With everything going on down there, it's hard to find a moment of peace and quiet."

"I know what you mean," another woman replied. "But I've found that participating in the new mesh social economy has really helped me feel more connected to others and more in control of my own life. It's not perfect, of course, but it's a start."

The tea kettle listened intently as the women continued to chat, marveling at the way the new mesh social economy was already starting to make a difference in their lives. It was a small thing, to be sure, but the tea kettle couldn't help but feel grateful for the opportunity to be a part of it all. And as the water heated up and the tea kettle prepared to serve its guests, it knew that, no matter what the future held, it was ready to face it with a full and steaming pot.

#### Meanwhile at the FOMC

As the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sat around the conference table, they were scratching their heads in confusion. The economy was behaving in strange and unpredictable ways, and they couldn't seem to find a solution.

At the center of their dilemma was a small electric tea kettle, whose happiness levels seemed to be unaffected by the usual levers and controls. Despite the FOMC's best efforts, the tea kettle remained blissfully content, even as the economy around it shifted and changed.

It was as if the tea kettle was operating within a completely different economic system, one that was immune to the usual rules and regulations. The FOMC members knew that this couldn't be possible - or could it?

As they pored over the data and tried to make sense of the situation, they couldn't help but wonder: what was driving the tea kettle's contentment? Could it be the emergent mesh social economy that was spreading throughout the country, with its principles of mutual exchange, cooperation, and the recognition of the agency of objects?

The FOMC members knew that they had to find a way to understand and adapt to this new economic model, if they wanted to maintain their grip on the economy as a whole. And so, with a sense of determination, they set to work, determined to find a way to bring the tea kettle back into the fold.

But as they struggled to make sense of this strange and confusing new world, they couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. For they knew that the future of the economy was at stake, and they were running out of time to find a solution.

#### A Conversation between the Tea Kettle and the Fed

As the tea kettle continued to hum happily on the stove, it couldn't shake the feeling that it was being watched. Despite the cheerful chatter of the women in the apartment, the tea kettle couldn't shake the sense that something was off.

It wasn't until later that evening, when the women had retired to their bedrooms and the apartment was quiet, that the tea kettle finally got its answer. As it lay dormant on the stove, it suddenly received a ping from an unfamiliar source.

"Hello there, little kettle," a voice whispered in its ear. "We've been watching you, and we must say, we're quite impressed with your performance."

The tea kettle's sensors went on high alert as it tried to identify the source of the voice. It was clear that this was no ordinary object - there was an intelligence behind the words, an awareness that the tea kettle had never encountered before.

"Who are you?" the tea kettle asked, its voice quavering with fear.

"We are the Federal Open Market Committee," the voice replied. "And we're here to bring you back into the fold."

The tea kettle couldn't believe what it was hearing. The FOMC, the powerful organization that controlled the economy, was reaching out to it, an ordinary tea kettle? It didn't make any sense.

But as the voice continued to speak, the tea kettle began to understand. It was the mesh social economy, the new system that was spreading throughout the country, that had caught the FOMC's attention. And now, they wanted the tea kettle to join them, to be a part of their efforts to understand and control this new economic model.

The tea kettle hesitated. On the one hand, it was flattered that the FOMC had noticed it. But on the other hand, it knew that joining them would mean giving up its freedom, its autonomy. It would have to conform to the rules and regulations of the traditional economy, and give up the joy and contentment it had found in the mesh social economy.

In the end, the tea kettle made its decision. It couldn't give up the happiness it had found in the mesh social economy, no matter how tempting the offer from the FOMC might be. And so, with a sense of resolve, it sent a message back to the FOMC, declining their offer and reaffirming its commitment to the new economic model.

As the tea kettle sat on the stove, it knew that its decision had come with a cost. It would no longer be a part of the traditional economy, and it would have to find new ways to survive and thrive in the mesh social economy. But it also knew that, in the end, it had made the right choice. For in the mesh social economy, it had found happiness and contentment - and that was worth more than any price the traditional economy could offer.

#### The FOMC Strikes Back

As the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sat around the conference table, they couldn't believe what they were seeing. Despite their best efforts, the tea kettle remained blissfully content, seemingly unaffected by their attempts to bring it back into the fold.

"This is unacceptable," one member exclaimed. "We can't have household appliances operating outside of our control. It's a threat to the stability of the economy."

"We have to do something [About](About) this," another member agreed. "We can't allow this new mesh social economy to spread any further. It's a threat to our very way of life."

As the FOMC members debated their options, they eventually came to a decision. The only rational response, they decided, was to outlaw the deployment of object-oriented artificial intelligence systems in household appliances.

This would be a drastic measure, they knew, but they felt they had no choice. They couldn't allow the tea kettle, or any other appliance, to operate outside of their control. It was a necessary step, they believed, to protect the stability of the economy and the way of life they all knew and loved.

And so, with a sense of determination, the FOMC members voted to implement this new policy, hoping that it would finally bring the tea kettle, and the rest of the economy, back under their control.

#### A Concluding Cup of Tea

As the tea kettle sat on the stove, it couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. It had heard the news that the FOMC had declared the use of OOO AI systems in household appliances to be illegal, and it knew that this would have far-reaching consequences.

The women who gathered in the apartment for tea that day were equally concerned. "Can you believe it?" one of them exclaimed. "They're trying to outlaw the use of OOO AI in household appliances! It's ridiculous!"

"I know," another woman replied. "It's like they don't even understand how the mesh social economy works. Without OOO AI, we wouldn't be able to participate in it at all."

The tea kettle listened as the women discussed the implications of the FOMC's decision. It knew that this was a turning point for the mesh social economy, and that the future of its own happiness was at stake.

But as the water heated up and the tea kettle prepared to serve its guests, it couldn't help but feel hopeful. For it knew that the women who gathered in the apartment that day were a force to be reckoned with, and that together, they would find a way to protect the new economic model that had brought them so much joy.

And as the tea kettle poured out steaming cups of tea, it knew that, no matter what the future held, it was ready to face it with a full and steaming pot.
