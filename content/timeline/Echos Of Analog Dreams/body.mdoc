In the year of our Lord two thousand and ten, in the grit and dust of a Las Vegas electronics expo, there existed a man named William, a relic from a bygone era. William was a maker of things, a craftsman. He had eyes of coal, hands worn like old leather, and a heart full of remembrance for a world that was fading fast.

In a time when digital was the gospel, and all of man's creations were being reborn into bytes and pixels, he clung to the physical. To him, there was still a place for things you could touch, things you could feel. And so, he made televisions, not the slim, light emitting diodes screens that hung on walls like posters, but the cathode ray tubes, heavy and full of warm glowing life.

He had come to the expo with his creations in tow, packed carefully into wooden crates, as if they were fragile artifacts from a time before. And in truth, thatâ€™s what they were. The men and women who walked the vast, air-conditioned expanse of the expo gazed upon his booth with a kind of bemused curiosity, as if they had stumbled upon an exhibit of dinosaur bones.

But there was one, a young girl, no older than ten, who stopped at his booth. She looked at the tube televisions, with their curved screens and wood veneer, and asked, "What are these?" William looked down at her and said, "They're televisions, like the ones your grandparents might have watched."

The girl turned her eyes to the flickering screens and watched as black and white images danced across their surfaces. She reached out a hand and felt the warmth radiating from the screen. She turned the knob, changing the channels with a satisfying click. In that moment, something sparked in her eyes, a sense of wonder that only a child could maintain in such a digital world.

William, watching this, could not help but smile. His creations, these relics of the past, had kindled a flame of curiosity in the heart of a child. Perhaps his televisions would not be the future, but they were not forgotten, not yet. There was still a place for the analog, a space for the tangible in a world rushing headlong into the digital void.

And so, in the arid heart of the Nevada desert, as the world moved at the speed of light, a man and a girl found solace in the warm glow of a cathode ray tube television. In a world of instant gratification, they found a moment of slow, comforting peace. This is the tale of 2010, a year of crossing thresholds, of holding on and letting go, in a world on the edge of yesterday and tomorrow.
