[Xander Veritas](Xander Veritas) was a man who had seen the dark corners of the universe and survived. He carried the weight of a thousand stories etched into the lines on his face, the scars that marked his body, and the ghosts that haunted his dreams. The cosmos had tried to crush him, to snuff out the flickering flame of his spirit, but he had emerged unbowed, a man forged in the crucibles of war and the treacherous life of a smuggler.

The void had taken its toll on Xander, but it had also given him the gift of perspective. He had seen the worst of humanity, but he had also seen the best. The selflessness of comrades-in-arms, the unbreakable bonds of loyalty, and the unwavering belief in something greater than oneself. These were the things that kept him going, the memories and emotions that held the darkness at bay.

When the message arrived, it came like a whisper from a forgotten past, a fragile thread that tethered him to a time when he had fought for something more than just survival. It was from Damien Raynor, a man he had once called brother, who had fought by his side in the great war that had torn the [Four Moons Of America](Four Moons Of America) asunder. They had been soldiers, bound by blood and fire, but the years had pulled them apart, sending them on different paths.

Damien's message was a plea, a final request from a dying man. He had been stricken with a disease that had no cure, and his time was running out. He had a daughter, Lila, a child he would leave behind in a cold and unforgiving universe. But he had one last gift for her, a sentient teddy bear named Mr. Snuggles, a guardian and companion who would watch over her when he was gone.

The bear was hidden on a distant moon, a place where the law held no sway, and the dark currents of the cosmos ebbed and flowed like a tide of shadows. It was a dangerous place, but Xander knew that he could not refuse his friend's request. He would bring Mr. Snuggles to Lila, no matter the cost.

As he set out on his journey, Xander felt the weight of the past pressing down on him, a burden that threatened to consume him. But he was no stranger to hardship, and he bore it as he always had, with a grim determination that brooked no surrender. He navigated the treacherous asteroid fields and the cold reaches of space, his ship a solitary speck of light in an ocean of darkness.

The moon was a desolate place, a dead world where hope went to die. The air was thin and the wind howled like a banshee, clawing at Xander's face as he made his way through the ruins of an ancient civilization. He found the bear hidden away in a crumbling building, its eyes glowing with a soft light that seemed to defy the darkness that surrounded it.

As he left the moon, Xander found himself pursued by the denizens of the dark, men who had sold their souls for power and profit, who cared nothing for the lives they destroyed. He fought them in the cold void of space, his ship dancing and weaving through the stars like a deadly predator, its weapons flashing like the eyes of a wrathful god. He knew that he could not fail, that the fate of a child was in his hands, and he fought with a ferocity that sent his enemies reeling.

The battle was long and brutal, but Xander emerged victorious, his ship scarred and battered, but unbowed. He had defied the darkness, but the cost had been great. The engines strained and groaned, the ship limping through the void like a wounded animal, its lifeblood leaking into the cold embrace of the cosmos. But Xander knew that he could not give up, that he had made a promise that he intended to keep.

He nursed the ship along, coaxing every last ounce of power from its dying engines, the darkness nipping at his heels like a pack of ravenous wolves. He thought of Lila, a girl he had never met but whose fate now rested in his hands. He thought of Damien, the friend he had left behind, and the life they had once shared. And he thought of Mr. Snuggles, the sentient teddy bear that was now his ward and companion, the last link to a past that was fading like the embers of a dying star.

The journey was long and fraught with danger, but Xander was nothing if not stubborn. He pushed through the pain and the exhaustion, refusing to let the darkness claim him. He thought of the stories he had heard, tales of men who had stared into the abyss and found the strength to fight back, to defy the cruel hand of fate. And he realized that he was now one of those men, a character in a story that would be told in hushed whispers around the fires of a thousand worlds.

When he finally reached Lila's home, a small outpost on the fringes of the [Four Moons Of America](Four Moons Of America), Xander was a broken man, his body and spirit pushed to the very limits of endurance. But he had succeeded, defying the odds and delivering Mr. Snuggles into the hands of a girl who had lost everything.

The moment when he handed the bear to Lila was one that would be forever etched into his memory, the look of wonder and joy on her face as she hugged her new friend close. He saw, in that instant, the power of hope and love, the force that could drive a man to defy the darkness and risk everything for a single, shining moment of redemption.

As Xander left Lila's home, his heart heavy with the weight of his past and the knowledge that his journey was far from over, he knew that he had found something precious, something that the darkness could never take away. The girl's innocent joy and gratitude had rekindled a spark of hope within him that had long been dormant.

Before he left, Lila's mother had pressed a worn, folded piece of paper into his hand. "It's from Damien," she said, her eyes glistening with tears. "He wanted you to have this, in case you ever found your way here." Xander unfolded the paper, finding a short message scrawled in his old friend's familiar handwriting.

*Brother, if you're reading this, it means you've made it through hell and back. I know the world has tried to break you, but I've always believed in you. Remember, even in the darkest moments, there's still something worth fighting for. I've left you a gift in your ship. It'll help you on your next journey. - D*

As Xander made his way back to his ship, he was filled with a sense of purpose and determination. The ship had seen better days, but it was still capable of one more flight, one more mission. He found the gift Damien had left for him: the nav was loaded with a set of coordinates, pointing to a remote and mysterious location at the edge of the [Four Moons Of America](Four Moons Of America). A new challenge awaited him there, an opportunity to continue fighting the darkness that had threatened to consume him.

He couldn't change the past or erase the pain he had caused, but Xander knew he could still make a difference in the lives of others. With each small act of kindness, each selfless deed, he would begin to mend the broken pieces of his soul.

As he prepared his ship for its next journey, Xander Veritas felt a sense of renewal, a promise of redemption. Though his body was battered and his spirit weary, the fire within him had been rekindled, burning with newfound intensity. The heart of gold that beat within his chest was a force that could not be extinguished, a light that would guide him through the darkest nights and the most treacherous storms. And as he set off into the vast expanse of the cosmos, he knew that he would carry that hope with him, a beacon of resilience and determination that would shine brightly for all eternity.

## Part Two - Haven's Rest

The heavy weight of the teddy bear's note hung in Xander's mind like an anchor, the coordinates it bore etched into his memory. There was something about them, something that stirred the ghosts of his past and called to the fire that still burned within him. He knew that following the coordinates would lead him down a path fraught with danger, but his heart of gold refused to let him turn away from the challenge.

His ship navigated the star-studded expanse of space, the cold darkness pressing in around them like a shroud. Xander's thoughts turned to Damien, the man who had fought by his side during the war, and who had entrusted him with the precious cargo of a sentient teddy bear. Damien had never spoken of these coordinates, and yet their significance haunted Xander's every thought.

As the journey wore on, Xander found himself poring over old logs and communications from the time he had spent with Damien. He searched for any clue, any hint as to the importance of the destination he now raced towards. The search was an exercise in futility, the fragments of the past refusing to yield their secrets.

It was only as the ship began its descent towards the mysterious location that Xander stumbled upon an old message, one that had been tucked away and forgotten. It was from Damien, and it spoke of a place where they could find solace when the weight of their sins threatened to crush them beneath its heel. A sanctuary, hidden away from the eyes of the world, where the weary and the downtrodden could find refuge from the storm.

As the ship touched down on the surface of the small, uncharted moon, Xander's heart hammered in his chest. The landscape that greeted him was one of untamed beauty, the jagged peaks of mountains and the vast expanse of wild forests stretching out as far as the eye could see. A feeling of tranquility settled over him, the chaos of the universe seemingly held at bay by the serenity of this hidden sanctuary.

But this sanctuary was not as untouched as it first appeared. Xander soon discovered signs of human habitation, of a small colony that had sprung up in the heart of the wilderness. The people there lived a simple life, far removed from the chaos and conflict that plagued the [Four Moons Of America](Four Moons Of America). They welcomed Xander with open arms, and as he listened to their stories, he began to understand why Damien had chosen this place as their refuge.

This colony, known as Haven's Rest, was founded by those who had fled the devastation of war, seeking a place where they could build a new life free from the violence and oppression that had torn their world apart. Yet the shadow of the past still hung over them, a darkness that threatened to consume all that they had built.

As Xander spent time among the people of Haven's Rest, he began to learn of the struggles they faced. A powerful and cruel warlord had set his sights on the colony, determined to bend its people to his will and plunder the resources that lay hidden beneath the surface of the moon. The people of Haven's Rest were ill-equipped to face this threat, and their fragile peace teetered on the brink of collapse.

The people of Haven's Rest, their faces etched with lines of worry and fear, found themselves in the shadow of a force they could not withstand. A warlord by the name of Vorik had set his sights upon their land, his heart a black pit of greed and malice. A ruthless conqueror, Vorik sought to strip the land of its resources, including the rare and valuable <vantium> that lay beneath the surface. The people, simple farmers and miners, were ill-equipped to face Vorik and his marauding band of mercenaries.

As Xander listened to their stories, he couldn't help but feel the stirrings of sympathy in the hollow of his chest. But it was a more personal, tangible motivation that finally lured him to take up their cause. If he could help defend the colony and secure access to the vantium, Xander could leave behind the shadows of his smuggling days, and step into the light of a new beginning.

The landscape of Haven's Rest spoke to Xander of the beauty and fragility that lay within the heart of every living thing, a testament to the indomitable spirit of life that pushed back against the darkness. As he walked among the people, their faces now marked with the first hints of hope, he felt a kinship with them that he had not known for many long years. They, like him, bore the scars of a past that refused to release its hold upon them, the weight of their sins threatening to pull them beneath the surface of the cold, dark waters.

Xander knew that to protect Haven's Rest and its people, he would have to confront Vorik and the darkness that he represented. It would not be an easy battle, for the warlord was cunning and ruthless, his mercenaries driven by a bloodlust that knew no bounds. But Xander had not come this far, had not fought his way through the dark corners of the universe, to stand idly by while the innocent suffered at the hands of a monster.

He began to formulate a plan, drawing upon his knowledge of guerrilla warfare and the tactics he had honed during his time as a smuggler. He knew that the people of Haven's Rest, though untrained in the ways of war, were willing to fight for their home and their freedom. Together, they would stand against Vorik and his forces, their hearts beating in unison to the rhythm of a world that refused to be silenced.

The days turned to nights, and the nights to days, as Xander and the people of Haven's Rest prepared for the coming battle. They gathered their meager weapons, fashioning crude defenses from the materials they had on hand. Xander taught them the art of guerrilla warfare, instructing them in the ways of stealth and subterfuge. They practiced moving silently through the forests, striking at their enemy from the shadows before disappearing back into the night. Their progress was slow, but the fire of determination burned bright within them, fueled by the knowledge that they were fighting for their very survival.

As the day of reckoning drew near, Xander found himself grappling with the ghosts of his past. He had come to Haven's Rest in search of redemption, seeking to atone for the sins he had committed in the name of survival. But as he stood on the precipice of battle, he wondered if he would ever truly be free of the darkness that had followed him through the stars. The weight of his past threatened to crush him beneath its heel, and he knew that the only way to break free of its hold was to confront it head-on.

The battle for Haven's Rest began under the cloak of night, the darkness pierced by the harsh glare of the mercenaries' searchlights. Xander and the people of Haven's Rest moved like wraiths through the shadows, striking at Vorik's forces with a ferocity born of desperation. The enemy was caught off guard, their overconfidence in their own might proving to be their undoing.

As the fighting wore on, Xander found himself locked in a deadly dance with Vorik himself. The warlord was a formidable opponent, his every move calculated to bring pain and suffering to those who dared stand in his way. But Xander was no stranger to the dance of death, and he met each of Vorik's strikes with a grace and skill that belied the years he had spent wandering the dark corners of the universe.

In the heart of the battle, as the world crumbled around them, Xander and Vorik faced each other on a field of blood and fire. Their eyes locked, and in that moment, Xander saw the darkness that lay within the heart of the warlord. He saw the hunger that drove him, the insatiable desire for power and control that had consumed his soul. But Xander also saw the flicker of fear that lay hidden beneath the surface, the knowledge that he, too, was mortal and fallible.

As their blades clashed, Xander found within himself a strength he had not known he possessed. It was a strength born of the love and hope that he had discovered in Haven's Rest, and the knowledge that he was fighting for something far greater than himself. With each strike, he pushed back against the darkness that threatened to consume them all, his heart beating in time with the pulse of the world around him.

The battle raged on, a cacophony of steel and blood that seemed to have no end. But as the first light of dawn began to break upon the horizon, Xander found an opening in Vorik's defenses. With a cry that seemed to echo through the ages, he drove his blade through the heart of the warlord, watching as the light faded from his eyes.

As Vorik's lifeless body crumpled to the ground, Xander knew that the battle had been won. The people of Haven's Rest had fought bravely, their determination and courage driving back the darkness that had sought to claim their home. But the cost had been great, and as Xander surveyed the carnage that lay before him, he knew that the wounds they had sustained would take time to heal.

In the aftermath of the battle, as the people of Haven's Rest began the long process of rebuilding their lives, Xander found himself at a crossroads. He had helped to save the colony and secure the precious vantium that would allow him to leave his past behind. But the ghosts of his past still clung to him, their whispers a constant reminder of the darkness that lay within the heart of every man.

As Xander stood among the ruins of Haven's Rest, the weight of his newfound power settled heavily upon his shoulders. He had succeeded in securing the vantium supply, a resource so valuable that it could change the fate of entire worlds. In his hands, this precious material held the potential for both great good and terrible evil. And as he looked upon the faces of the people who had fought alongside him, he realized that he held more than just the keys to their survival – he had their loyalty, their devotion, and their willingness to follow him into the unknown.

Dark thoughts began to invade Xander's mind, a whispering chorus of temptation and doubt that gnawed at the edges of his consciousness. He could use the vantium and the people of Haven's Rest to forge an empire, to bend the universe to his will and bring those who had once sought to destroy him to their knees. He could make himself a king among the stars, feared and respected in equal measure, his past transgressions forgotten in the face of his newfound power.

But as the shadows of his past swirled around him, Xander knew that such a path would only lead him deeper into the darkness that had plagued him for so long. To wield his power in the name of vengeance and conquest would be to betray the ideals that had brought him to Haven's Rest, and the promise of redemption that lay within its borders. He had fought against the darkness in Vorik's heart, and now he found himself locked in battle with the darkness within his own soul.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the landscape, Xander wrestled with his inner demons. He knew that the power he now wielded could be a force for incredible good, or it could lead him down a path from which there would be no return. The ghosts of his past urged him to embrace the darkness, to use his newfound influence to right the wrongs that had been done to him and to exact a terrible vengeance upon his enemies.

Yet, even as these dark thoughts swirled through his mind, Xander felt a flicker of hope. The people of Haven's Rest, who had shown him the strength that could be found in unity and the power of a heart that refused to give in to despair. They had fought beside him, not out of fear or obligation, but because they believed in the promise of a better tomorrow.

As the stars began to appear in the night sky, Xander made his decision. He would not allow the darkness within him to consume the light that he had found in Haven's Rest. He would use the vantium and the loyalty of the people not to forge an empire, but to build a brighter future for all, one in which the shadows of the past would be left behind.

Under the vast canopy of the night sky, Xander, burdened by the weight of his past, pondered the fate of Haven's Rest. The dark, twisted trails of his past had led him to a crossroads, and he wrestled with the demons that haunted his soul. There was another reckoning he could not ignore: the debt he owed to the [Only Science Syndicate](Only Science Syndicate) (OSS). That shadowy and powerful faction, their presence felt like a cold, merciless specter, had suffered a loss when one of Xander's smuggling operations failed, scattering contraband to the void of the cosmos.

The OSS demanded recompense, and Xander knew the price would be steep. He knew, too, that the OSS would not be forgiving if he failed to repay his debt, and the wrath of the Syndicate was not something any soul dared to provoke. The discovery of vantium beneath the surface of Haven's Rest presented an opportunity, a sliver of redemption that gleamed in the darkness. If he could extract enough of the precious resource, he could settle his debt with the OSS and, perhaps, find some measure of solace.

As Xander set his sights on the task at hand, the people of Haven's Rest, their spirits tempered by hardship and battle, seemed like ghosts, their presence a reminder of the fragile balance of life in the frontier. They had fought and bled for their land, their hearts bound by a common purpose. Now, they looked to Xander for guidance, their faith in him like a beacon in the night.

Xander's heart lay heavy within his chest as he considered the path that lay before him. It was a road fraught with peril, and the choices he made would have consequences that echoed through the stars. The extraction of the vantium would require sacrifice, and the people of Haven's Rest would have to endure the hardships that accompanied it. But it was a burden they would have to bear, for the specter of the OSS loomed large.

In the months that followed, Xander drove the people of Haven's Rest with an iron will, pushing them to their limits in their quest to extract the vantium. The days were long, and the nights offered little respite, for the specter of the OSS haunted Xander's dreams, a relentless reminder of the debt he owed and the precarious balance that hung in the balance.

The people labored tirelessly beneath the unforgiving gaze of a distant sun, their hands calloused and their bodies wracked with exhaustion. The mines cut deep into the heart of the moon, their jagged maws swallowing the light and leaving only darkness in their wake. The air within the tunnels was heavy with dust, and the sound of pickaxes striking rock echoed through the void, a constant refrain that bore witness to the struggles of those who toiled in the bowels of the earth.

Xander watched as the people of Haven's Rest, once so full of hope and determination, were slowly ground down by the relentless pace of their labor. The weight of their toil seemed to rest upon his shoulders, a burden that grew heavier with each passing day. The darkness that lurked within his heart, a legacy of the sins he had committed in the name of survival, threatened to consume him, and he found himself teetering on the edge of an abyss, the light of redemption a distant, flickering beacon.

The nights offered no solace, for the cold, unforgiving stars bore witness to the torment that plagued Xander's soul. The ghost of the OSS haunted his dreams, a malevolent presence that drove him to the brink of madness, its whispers a constant reminder of the price he would pay if he failed to deliver the vantium. The fear of their retribution gnawed at the edges of his consciousness, an ever-present specter that left him tossing and turning on his sweat-soaked cot.

As the weeks turned to months, the darkness within Xander grew, a consuming force that threatened to swallow him whole. His heart was heavy with the knowledge of the suffering he had brought upon the people of Haven's Rest, and the weight of their pain was a millstone around his neck. The mines produced more and more vantium, but the scales seemed impossible to balance, and Xander found himself caught in a maelstrom of guilt and desperation.

In the darkest hours of the night, Xander would stand at the edge of the mining encampment, gazing out across the stark, unforgiving landscape of the moon. The wind whispered through the desolate expanse, carrying with it the echoes of the past and the ghosts of the future. In those moments, Xander would wonder if the path he had chosen was the right one, if the sacrifices he had made in the name of redemption would ever be enough to cleanse his soul of the darkness that clung to it like a shroud. And as the specter of the OSS loomed large in the night, he knew that he would have to face the consequences of his actions, and that the road ahead would be a long and treacherous one.

<a id="part-3-a-sit-down-with-ten-ton-tuna"></a>
## Part 3 - A Sit-Down with Ten Ton Tuna

Xander found himself wandering through the dim corridors of the OSS diplomatic enclave, the silence of the Nexus Space Station weighing heavy upon him like a shroud. The spectral glow of the station's lights cast an eerie pallor over the deserted halls, their shadows stretching out before him like the fingers of some ancient, malevolent force. It seemed that, in this forsaken corner of the universe, even the very air whispered of secrets and hidden truths.

As he made his way through the labyrinthine passages, Xander's thoughts turned inward, a maelstrom of doubt and fear churning within the depths of his soul. The people of Haven's Rest, the lives he had so callously bent to his own will, haunted the recesses of his mind, their pain and suffering a constant reminder of the price that had been paid in the name of survival. And now, he found himself at the doorstep of the OSS, their enigmatic presence a specter that loomed large over his every waking moment.

The enclave was a monument to the syndicate's shadowy culture, a testament to the unseen forces that governed the fates of so many. The walls were adorned with the fragmented images of a thousand broken dreams, their shattered pieces forming a mosaic of despair that seemed to beckon him ever onward. And yet, it was here, in this forsaken place, that Xander hoped to find redemption, to strike a bargain that would release him from the crushing weight of his debt.

At last, he arrived at the appointed chamber, a cold and sterile room that seemed to exist outside the bounds of time and space. In the center of the room, a spectral hologram flickered into existence, its glitched form shimmering with horrifying iridescence, each scale on the monster reflecting a moment of victory in the OSS' ruthless campaign to control the [Four Moons Of America](Four Moons Of America). The [Ten Ton Tuna](Ten Ton Tuna), the OSS's enigmatic spokesfish, had made its presence known.

Xander's heart hammered in his chest as he approached the digital apparition, the realization of his purpose heavy upon him. He steeled himself, calling upon the reserves of courage and determination that had carried him through countless trials, and began to speak.

"I have come to negotiate the settlement of my debt," he said, his voice steady despite the fear that clenched his heart like a vice. "I have brought with me a payment of vantium, extracted from the depths of the outer belt by the hands of those who have labored in my name. I offer this as a token of my commitment to right the wrongs of my past and to forge a brighter future for us all."

The Ten Ton Tuna regarded him with an inscrutable gaze, its glitched form shifting and flickering like the shadows that danced upon the walls of the enclave. The silence hung heavy in the air, a palpable tension that seemed to resonate with the very fabric of the universe. And as Xander stood there, beneath the watchful eye of the OSS's enigmatic emissary, he knew that he stood on the precipice of a grueling and difficult negotiation. Ten Ton Tuna was an indomitable diplomat and trader, the fish's prowess as a sharp wit and cunning statesfish set it clearly above all others in the political world of the Four Moons. Xander was overmatched but resolute, for he had the upper hand here. Vantium was a critical resource in the OSS's plans for expansion and dearly needed.

As Xander sat down he had three objectives: leave alive, settle his debt, and to not betray the source of the Vantium lest the OSS scour the people of Haven's Rest from the universe. Ten Ton Tuna's enormous bulging side eyes sized Xander up and the test of wits commenced.

Ten Ton Tuna: "Xander Veritas, your reputation precedes you. However, your debt to the Only Science Syndicate has been a lingering issue. Your failed operation has cost us significantly."

Xander Veritas: "I'm well aware of my obligations, Tuna. I've been in this business long enough to know that debts need to be settled. That's why I'm here. I've got something that might interest the OSS. Something that could square us."

Ten Ton Tuna: "Your words pique my interest, Veritas. The OSS is always open to opportunities. What do you propose?"

Xander Veritas: "Vantium. A resource as rare as they come. And I've got a steady supply of it."

Ten Ton Tuna: "Vantium, you say? That's a valuable asset, Veritas. But the extraction process is known to be grueling, and the quantity matters. How much are we talking about?"

Xander Veritas: "Enough to cover my debt, and then some. But this isn't a one-way street, Tuna. I need assurances from the OSS."

Ten Ton Tuna: "Assurances? You're in a precarious position, Veritas. You don't have the luxury to make demands."

Xander Veritas: "Maybe not. But without my help, you won't get your hands on that vantium. I need to know the OSS will keep their noses out of my business. No interference. No threats."

Ten Ton Tuna: "That's a bold request, Veritas. But the source of this vantium, where is it coming from?"

Xander Veritas: "That's not part of the deal, Tuna. All you need to know is that it's a clean source. No strings attached, no blowback on the OSS."

Ten Ton Tuna: "A clean source, you say? That's a tempting offer, Veritas. But the OSS doesn't operate on blind faith. We need assurances too."

Xander Veritas: "You'll get your vantium, Tuna. That's my assurance. And in return, the OSS stays out of my way. This is a one-time deal. I'm giving you something more precious than credits. I want to be free and clear from the OSS."

Ten Ton Tuna: "A one-time deal, Veritas? That's a steep ask. The OSS could wipe the slate clean on your old debt, but we would need something more. Another job, perhaps."

Xander Veritas: "Another job? I'm trying to get out, Tuna, not dig myself deeper. I want my life back."

Ten Ton Tuna: "The OSS understands your position, Veritas. But you're a valuable asset. We can't just let you walk away. We'll respect your need for space, but we'll need to call on you in the future."

Xander Veritas: "I need some time, Tuna. Time to settle the darkness inside me. You can call on me for another job, but not now. I need to be free for a while."

Ten Ton Tuna: "Understood, Veritas. The OSS honors its agreements. We'll wipe your slate clean and give you the space you need. But remember, we will call on you when the time is right."

Xander Veritas: "That's a deal I can live with, Tuna. But I'll be watching. Any sign of trouble from the OSS, and our deal is off."

Ten Ton Tuna, the silent observer, watched from the shadows as Xander Veritas, the man of a thousand stories, walked away from the heart of the OSS diplomatic enclave within Nexus City. The neon lights of the city reflected off the polished surface of the buildings, casting an ethereal glow on Xander's retreating figure. The city, with its ceaseless hum of activity, seemed to pause for a moment, as if acknowledging the weight of the man who walked its streets.

A man of Xander's talents was a rare commodity, a gem in the rough that the syndicate would seek to polish and use for their own ends. They would attempt to reel him in, to ensnare him in their web of power and control. But Xander was a man to be tamed, not a man to be used and discarded.

As Xander disappeared into the labyrinth of the city, Tuna contemplated the path that lay ahead. The OSS would try to sink their hooks into Xander, to pull him into their grasp. But Xander was a force of nature, a storm that could not be tamed, a man who would fight to the bitter end. The OSS would need a most clever gambit to ensnare Veritas. Tuna knew he was capable of devising one, but it would take time and the right opportunity. For now, Xander could go about his life believing he was a free man, but he had made a critical mistake and was now marked for service in the OSS.
