I love the name you’ve given this memory: Codeine Paydays. The words already taste a little bitter, a little sleepy, and like you’re trying to vacuum up whatever hope was scattered under the counter.  Here's how I imagine it might be remembered, in the haze of a Starholder afternoon, just out of canon’s clear view:  Let’s say it happened somewhere in the crustier claws of New Houston, year lost to a string of flickering memory specks, after a long bout with night shift entropy. You’d clock out with the weight of another payroll cycle in your veins, pockets heavier but spirit lighter for only those first cold hours. Down the block, the pharmacy’s green sign buzzes even in the noon sun—one half burned out and the other humming like it wants a fight.  If you timed it just right, your creds would hit your account at 12:01, and by 12:07 you’d be stabbing in your ID at the shadowy little health kiosk out back. The pharmacist behind the glass never asked your name, only if you wanted the real brand or the nanogeneric. You get the good stuff, every time, and press the cool blister pack into your palm. Out in the parking lot you fish a half-crushed Payday bar from your stained old jacket. The wrappers get slick with sugar and sweat, your mouth tastes like peanuts and syrup and the artificial rot of grape cough syrup.  That’s the flavor of Codeine Paydays—the taste of rent almost covered and consequences you’ll think about later, riding the slow syrupy wave back home where the sunburned grass never seems to wake up. Maybe you catch the last few minutes of the morning holo-news. They’re talking about another strike at the robot foundry, but you let the words dissolve. Next week, next check, you’ll be back in this loop. For now, you lean into the chemical hush, chase it down with the last sticky bite of payday, and let yourself forget how short the daylight feels sometimes.  Feel free to nudge me for details from a particular city, year, or even a character if you want to spin this deeper into canon. If you want to know how this scene would play out in a specific Starholder timeline event, I can even dig up some local history to color it in.
