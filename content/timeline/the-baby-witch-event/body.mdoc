## Diary Entry by The Girl On An Errand to Get Bread

This diary entry was released by the Girl On An Errand to Get Bread as her only public statement regarding the event she played a pivotal role in:

Dear Diary,

Today was supposed to be a simple errand to pick up bread, but it ended up being a day full of shocking revelations. As I walked through the ad-laden streets, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. Then, as if on cue, a spell played through my headphones, capturing my every move.

As I listened to the spell, I became aware that a baby witch had constructed it, using real-time augmented reality data to show me the ads being served to me at that very moment. It was a mind-blowing realization, one that made me question everything I thought I knew [about](https://starholder.xyz/index.php?title=About&action=edit&redlink=1) my own reality.

But that was just the beginning. As the spell continued, I realized that my daydreams of being a crane were already being invaded by the feedback loop of capitalism. The zen-like tranquility of the moon in the water, a phenomenon that had always brought me peace, had been co-opted in a way that Marcuse warned us about. Suddenly, everything felt artificial and manipulated, as if there was no bread, no FOMC, and no escape from the feedback loop of the system I was in.

I began to feel the spell take hold, and I was on the verge of giving in to the baby witch's promises of virtual unicorn gizmos and the manipulation of the augmented reality ad market. But then, something snapped. I remembered the simple act of picking up bread, and I realized that it was these small, mundane tasks that gave my life meaning. I couldn't let go of them, no matter how tempting the baby witch's offer seemed.

In that moment, I made the decision to resist the spell and to continue on my errand for bread. It was a small, insignificant choice in the grand scheme of things, but it was one that allowed me to reclaim my agency and to find my way back to reality.

As I walked home, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the simple task of picking up bread. It had shown me the power of the mundane, and it had reminded me of the importance of staying grounded in the present moment.

And as I sat down to eat my loaf of bread, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. I had survived an encounter with witchcraft and come out stronger on the other side.

Until next time,

[Girl on an errand to get bread]

## FOMC Intervention

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is the principal monetary policy-making body of the Federal Reserve System, responsible for setting monetary policy in the United States. In 2029, the FOMC made an unusual intervention in the Baby Witch Event, a series of events involving a baby witch, headphones, and a girl on an errand to get bread.

Details of the FOMC's intervention are scarce, but it is believed that the Committee took action in response to the baby witch's use of magic and the potential implications for financial stability and the broader economy. It is unclear what specific measures the FOMC took in response to the event, but it is likely that the Committee used its powers to influence monetary policy and financial markets in order to address any potential threats to economic stability.

The FOMC's intervention in the Baby Witch Event was met with widespread curiosity and speculation, with many people wondering about the nature of the event and the motivations behind the Committee's actions. Some have questioned the appropriateness of the FOMC's involvement in what is perceived as a supernatural or unconventional event, while others have praised the Committee's proactive approach to addressing potential threats to the economy.

Despite the unusual circumstances surrounding the FOMC's intervention in the Baby Witch Event, the Committee's actions were ultimately successful in mitigating any negative effects on the economy and maintaining financial stability. The event remains a subject of fascination and debate, and serves as a reminder of the FOMC's mandate to ensure the stability and well-being of the financial system.

## Impact On Augmented Reality Advertising

The Baby Witch Event was a turning point in the history of augmented reality advertising. Prior to the event, the market for augmented reality advertising had exploded, with impressions served increasing from zero in 2017 to a saturation level in major urban areas by 2029. This proliferation was reminiscent of the scooter craze that swept through many cities at the same time, and was fueled by a flood of venture capital funding.

However, the Baby Witch Event exposed a major flaw in the security of augmented reality advertising. An upgrade in the industry standards to support EVM compatible smart contracts, led to integration with the [BLIV](bliv) spell crafting metaverse within AR ad delivery clearinghouse without proper vetting. Once it became incorporated in creator SDK bundles, a major attack vector was opened. The baby witch's use of magic to manipulate the girl's surroundings and experiences through the ad platform demonstrated that these systems were highly susceptible to hacking and exploitation through dark spellcraft.

In response to this threat, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) intervened in the Baby Witch Event and dramatically increased interest rates by 400%. This action was motivated by a desire to protect financial stability and the broader economy, but it also had the unintended consequence of decimating the augmented reality advertising industry. Despite numerous upgrades and patches to the platforms, dark spellcraft continued to be able to hijack them, leading to a widespread loss of confidence in the technology and the eventual shuttering of the industry.

The Baby Witch Event serves as a cautionary tale about the vulnerabilities of emerging technologies and the need for strong security measures to protect against unconventional threats. It also highlights the far-reaching consequences of such threats and the importance of anticipating and addressing them in a timely and effective manner.

### Lyrics

*The [Ballad of the Baby Witch](ballad-of-the-baby-witch)*

*Hear my words, oh girl on an errand to get bread Let my spell take hold, and let your path be guided by my magic As you walk through the city, let the augmented reality ads be bent to my will Let them show you the way, and bring you to your destination*

*And let the cranes, symbols of grace and wisdom Guide your steps as well May their presence bring you peace and clarity On your journey through the city's spell*

*May the moon in the water, a symbol of the yin and yang Bring balance and harmony to your journey Let it be a beacon in the night, guiding you forward On this quest to get bread*

*And let the wisdom of the elders, the Frankfurt School philosophers Who recognized the struggle of capitalism to control everything In its quest for growth, guide your decisions And help you navigate the challenges ahead*

*And now, let my magic reach its pinnacle I call upon the power of the coven To create an ad, an ode to you, oh girl on an errand to get bread A pop song, sticky sweet like bubble gum That will capture your attention and guide you to your destination*

*As you walk through the city streets The magic of the baby witch Will guide your steps and light your way On your journey to get bread*

*So let the spell take hold, and let the magic guide you To your destination, oh girl on an errand to get bread The pop song will stick in your head As the magic of the baby witch leads you ahead*
