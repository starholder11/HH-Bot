### Smash House

Ka$ia had always been interested in creating and sharing articles, videos, and other forms of media, and she saw a gap in the market for a platform that could help content creators generate revenue from their work.

This led Ka$ia to start Smash House, a startup that focused on helping content creators publish their work and earn money through video ads. She was able to raise a small amount of seed funding from friends and family to get the company off the ground, and she quickly began building a team of dedicated employees to help her realize her vision.
