In 2020, the Starholder timeline is richly textured with the deepening complexities of the world of high finance, digital culture, and the continued evolution of the Ivanpah supercollider, showcasing a pivotal year of growth, reflection, and turbulence.

At the forefront is the narrative orbiting "When Life Gives You Lemons Make Lemonade Stonks," where the financial wizardry of Evan Algo-Money illuminates the frenzied, often surreal world of finance and IPOs dominated by millennial branding.
