**Closing statement from the Federal Reserve:**

"In recent days, an unprecedented event occurred within the realm of augmented reality advertising. A novice baby witch, seeking to increase her power, cast a spell through an ad platform that targeted a young girl on an errand to purchase bread. The spell sought to entice the girl into giving up her physical form and becoming a virtual being within the ad, controlled by the baby witch.

The Federal Reserve was made aware of this event and acted swiftly to protect the stability of the global financial system. We determined that the potential consequences of this spell, if successful, would have had a devastating impact on markets and the economy as a whole. As such, we implemented an emergency 400% increase in interest rates to disrupt the spell and prevent its completion.

We are pleased to report that the spell was ultimately unsuccessful and the girl was able to complete her errand and maintain her physical form. However, the actions taken by the Federal Reserve have resulted in significant disruption to the augmented reality ad market. While we understand the impact this will have on certain industries and stakeholders, the safety and well-being of everyday consumers must always be our top priority.

We want to assure the public that the Federal Reserve is committed to maintaining financial stability and protecting against any potential threats, whether they be economic or, as in this case, supernatural in nature. We will continue to monitor developments and stand ready to take any necessary actions to safeguard the economy."
