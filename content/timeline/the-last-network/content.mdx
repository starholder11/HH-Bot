The Last Network is a 2019 novel by ChrisF exploring VR/AR technology.

Technology has a terrible hold on us, and it’s only getting worse. It’s in our homes, it’s in our minds, but it wants more. It always wants more. With each new innovation, Silicon Valley peers deeper into our souls, taking control, and pushing us in ways we never imagined. Amoral and out for revenge, [Rabbit Wilson](rabbit-wilson), has created the world’s most powerful social network. The technology is mind blowing, and everyone wants it. The thing is, Rabbit is not the sharing type.

He’d ruin everyone before going back to his old life. While Rabbit battles Silicon Valley, temptation lurks inside the Last Network. Designed for maximum manipulation and lacking safeguards, it’s only a matter of time before digital games turn into real world dangers.

Can anyone control the Last Network, or will Rabbit’s creation be his destruction? Travel deep into tech’s heart of darkness in this gripping, fast paced thriller where everyone has an angle and the product is the criminal.
