In the year 2059, as part of the ecosystem of Starholder, the Anti-Data Movement's engagement with "negative datasets" gives rise to a radical new principle in physics known as the Doctrine of Interstitial Reality. Physics, traditionally concerned with the tangible matter and definite forces of the universe, begins to reconsider things in light of omission and potentiality.

The Doctrine of Interstitial Reality postulates that just as matter and energy are central to physics, the voids and the potential paths that were not taken hold intrinsic properties that define the structure of the cosmos just as significantly. This doctrine implies that for every particle that exists or event that occurs, a shadow of non-occurrence also exists, echoing the choices and formations that could have been but are not.

Researchers in the field of Quantum Lacunae begin to apply these principles to quantum mechanics, where the concept of superposition already suggests that particles could be in all possible states at once. Now, they consider the negative superpositions — states that are defined by their non-existence, yet retaining an influence on the observable universe. They theorize that these negative states are crucial for understanding the balance of probabilities within the quantum field.

A practical application is in the development of the Null Quantum Computer (NQC). Building on the work of traditional quantum computers, NQCs not only calculate probabilities based on qubit states but also leverage the negative data sets of paths not taken, resulting in computational capabilities that surpass any previous models. NQCs can solve problems by factoring in the outcome spaces where traditional data points would not or could not exist, offering a volume of anti-solution space that informs and enriches the process.

The repercussions are vast. Scientists speculate that just as dark matter and dark energy affect the fabric of space, so too might "dark information" — the information that does not exist within our current datasets but influences reality from its negative space. In astrophysics, this impacts the search for parallel universes and the understanding of cosmic inflation, suggesting these absent universes have a tangible, albeit indirect, impact on our own.

In society, the Anti-Data Movement propels a philosophical drift away from a universe defined by presence, towards one that is shaped as much by absence. This perspective fosters a newfound reverence for the intangible, leading to the rise of an interstitial spirituality that celebrates what is unseen and unformed as the true scaffolding of reality.

Ultimately, the Anti-Data Movement and the Doctrine of Interstitial Reality redefine physics in 2059 not as a science of the observable, but as a science of the integral whole - enmeshing seen and unseen, matter and void, existence and non-existence in an indivisible dance of cosmic significance.
