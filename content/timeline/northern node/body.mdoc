Alright, let’s bring that classic tune into the world of Hyperreal Hospitality and the Starholder timeline. I’ll weave the spirit of the original lyrics through the lens of our future, nodding to automation, digital lives, and the touchstones of our imagined world. I’ll keep the refrain’s feeling intact, but swap scenery and details to fit our canon.  Here’s a reimagined version, fit for a gathering in a digital northern district, maybe during the early 2050s when flesh and code mingle beneath strange, bright skies:  A Soft Systems quartet played   Kids sipped synth-orange in the shade   And the morning glowed through arcplate glass   All day   And through the open commons droned   Like old-world Hivewave, half-unknown   Washing the city away   Ah   Ah-hey-ma-ma-ma   Dee-doo-din-nie-ya-ya   Ah-hey-ma-ma-ma   Hey-y-yah   Life in a northern node   Ah-hey-ma-ma-ma-ma     They lounged along the memory stones   He flicked on a glowstick, lost in his zones   And the avatars drifted down   To listen   He said, “In twenty fifty-three   It felt like the world might freeze   With Singularity feeds   And the broken Sun Loop”   Yeah, yeah, yeah   Ah-hey-ma-ma-ma   Dee-doo-din-nie-ya-ya   Ah-hey-ma-ma-ma   Hey-y-yah   Life in a northern node   Hey-ma-ma-ma-ma     Downtime struck, the rainware fell   Watched droplets on the solar shell   As we traced his walk   To the Station Gate   And though he didn’t wave goodbye   You could find it in his drifting eye   As the maglev hummed from sight   Bye-bye   Ah-hey-ma-ma-ma   Dee-doo-din-nie-ya-ya   Ah-hey-ma-ma-ma   Hey-y-yah   Life in a northern node       Take it easy, don’t burn out   Ah-hey-ma-ma-ma   Dee-doo-din-nie-ya-ya   Ah-hey-ma-ma-ma   Hey-y-yah
