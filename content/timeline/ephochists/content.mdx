In the year 2035, the world is on the brink of a massive transformation. The rapid progress of AI and automation has rendered countless jobs obsolete, while advances in biotechnology and medicine have all but eradicated scarcity. Amidst these changes, the old guard of gerontocracy, fueled by a lifetime of neoliberal values, struggles to maintain control over a society that has outgrown their ideals.

The story follows a group of young revolutionaries, known as the "Epochists", who seek to dismantle the gerontocracy and create a new world order that embraces the benefits of technology and the end of scarcity. They believe that the time has come for humanity to transition from a society driven by competition and accumulation to one of cooperation and shared abundance.

As the Epochists gain momentum, they start to unveil the hidden machinations of the gerontocrats, who have been covertly manipulating politics and the economy to maintain their grip on power. With the help of cutting-edge AI systems, the Epochists expose the outdated, self-serving principles of neoliberalism and its architects.

The story's protagonist, Lena, is a young, brilliant programmer who becomes disillusioned with the gerontocracy's stubborn resistance to change. She joins the Epochists and uses her skills to develop a decentralized, AI-driven economic model that promotes sustainability, equal opportunity, and the efficient allocation of resources.

As the Epochists' influence grows, they face fierce opposition from the gerontocrats, who launch a disinformation campaign and resort to sabotage in a desperate attempt to maintain their fading relevance. Despite the challenges, Lena and her fellow Epochists are determined to reshape society for the better, guided by their conviction that a new, more just world is not only possible but necessary.

In the end, the Epochists succeed in dismantling the gerontocracy and usher in a new era of collaboration and abundance. The world begins to heal from the scars of neoliberalism, and society collectively embraces the transformative power of AI and automation, forging a future where fear and scarcity give way to hope and shared prosperity.

In doing so, she discovers her true potential and gains the confidence to help create a more equitable future.

#### Radicalization
Lena's radicalization can be traced back to her childhood experiences with financial insecurity and witnessing the widening income inequality in her society. Growing up in a single-parent household, she saw her mother work tirelessly to make ends meet while others seemed to accumulate wealth effortlessly. Lena was sensitive to the injustices that stemmed from this imbalance and began to question the economic and political systems that perpetuated it.

Her interest in technology, specifically AI and automation, grew from her belief that these advancements held the potential to revolutionize society and create a more equitable distribution of resources. While attending university, Lena became increasingly disenchanted with the traditional tech industry, as she observed how the wealth generated by innovation often concentrated in the hands of a select few rather than benefiting the masses.

Lena's radicalization was further fueled when she began to research the role of gerontocracy in perpetuating the status quo. She discovered that the older generations, who controlled the majority of wealth and political power, were resistant to change and often made decisions that prioritized short-term gains over long-term sustainability. This realization prompted Lena to question the fundamental tenets of neoliberalism and capitalism, leading her to explore alternative economic models and political ideologies.

Upon learning [about](https://starholder.xyz/index.php?title=About&action=edit&redlink=1) the Epochists, a group that sought to dismantle the gerontocracy and establish a new society built on mutualism and cooperation, Lena found a community that shared her values and vision. She became an active member, using her technical skills and innovative mindset to help develop the AI-driven economic model that would enable the transition to a post-scarcity society. As her involvement with the Epochists deepened, Lena embraced her role as a radical agent of change, committed to creating a more just and equitable future.

## The Rise of the Epochists
The Epochists' origin story begins in the City University of New York (CUNY) system in 2021. At the time, a group of politically engaged students and faculty members started gathering to discuss the pressing issues they saw in society. These conversations often revolved around the intersection of technology, economics, and politics, with a particular focus on the growing income inequality and the increasing influence of gerontocracy in governance. This diverse group of individuals, with backgrounds in fields such as economics, sociology, computer science, and political science, were united by their shared belief that a more equitable, post-scarcity society was possible through the responsible use of technology and the reimagining of traditional power structures.

As word of their meetings and ideas spread, interest in the Epochist movement began to grow. Soon, student groups at other universities along the East Coast began to adopt the Epochist ideology, forming their own chapters and organizing events to discuss and promote their vision of a better future. The movement quickly gained momentum, attracting supporters from various backgrounds and age groups, all seeking to challenge the status quo and work towards a more just society.

### The Schumer Upset
In 2026, the Epochist movement made national headlines when they played a pivotal role in the successful primarying of Chuck Schumer's Senate seat. A charismatic and passionate Epochist candidate, Ariana Sandoval, managed to capture the imagination of the electorate with her calls for radical change, including the implementation of universal basic income, the dismantling of gerontocracy, and the promotion of environmentally sustainable policies. With the help of a well-organized grassroots campaign, Ariana won the Democratic primary, effectively ending Schumer's long-held political career.

The Epochists' success in unseating a powerful incumbent like Schumer demonstrated their growing influence and signaled a shift in the political landscape. This victory, coupled with their expansion into other regions of the country, propelled the movement into the national spotlight. The Epochists were no longer a fringe group, but a legitimate political force advocating for a transformative vision of society, where technological advancements and radical policy changes would pave the way for a more equitable and sustainable future.

### The Gerontocracy Strikes Back
The gerontocracy, shaken by the Epochists' victory and the unseating of Schumer, realized the threat that the movement posed to their long-held power and influence. They quickly mobilized to strike back against the Epochists, aiming to discredit and undermine the movement before it could gain further momentum.

1. Media Manipulation: Major news outlets, controlled by powerful and wealthy individuals with vested interests in maintaining the status quo, began to launch a coordinated media campaign against the Epochists. They painted the movement as radical, dangerous, and naïve, focusing on the most controversial aspects of their policy proposals and questioning the competence of their leaders.

2. Legislation: Influential politicians within the gerontocracy used their positions to introduce legislation aimed at curtailing the Epochists' influence. These bills targeted their funding sources, restricted their ability to organize on college campuses, and imposed burdensome regulations on their activities, all under the guise of protecting national security and preserving democratic values.

3. Infiltration and Disinformation: The gerontocracy deployed undercover agents to infiltrate the Epochist movement, attempting to sow discord and create internal divisions. These agents worked to spread disinformation, foster mistrust among members, and derail the organization's efforts from within.

4. Judicial Challenges: The gerontocracy leveraged their influence within the legal system to challenge the Epochists' victories in court, arguing that their electoral success was the result of illegal activities, such as voter fraud and campaign finance violations. While many of these challenges were ultimately unsuccessful, they served to create doubt about the legitimacy of the Epochist movement and drain their resources through costly legal battles.

5. Economic Pressure: Wealthy individuals and corporations with ties to the gerontocracy used their financial power to apply economic pressure on the Epochists. They withdrew support from organizations and individuals affiliated with the movement, threatened to boycott businesses that supported Epochist candidates, and lobbied for punitive economic measures against those who refused to fall in line.

Despite these aggressive tactics, the Epochists managed to maintain their resolve and continue fighting for their vision of a better future. The movement's leaders and supporters recognized that the gerontocracy's attacks were a sign that they were making progress and viewed these challenges as opportunities to further galvanize their base and build public support for their cause.

### The Deplatforming of Amelia
The deplatforming of Lena's mother, Amelia, marked a turning point in the gerontocracy's battle against the Epochists. Amelia was a respected and influential figure within the Epochist movement, known for her passionate speeches and thought-provoking essays on the potential of a post-scarcity society. As her following grew, the gerontocracy saw her as a significant threat to their power and control over society.

To silence Amelia and deter other potential Epochist supporters, the gerontocracy orchestrated a coordinated attack on her digital presence. Using their extensive network of contacts and resources, they managed to pressure major social media platforms and financial institutions to ban Amelia from their services, citing vaguely defined "violations of community guidelines" or "terms of service."

The deplatforming campaign was swift and merciless. Within days, Amelia's online accounts were shut down, her assets frozen, and her ability to receive donations or payments from supporters effectively severed. The gerontocracy hoped that this aggressive move would not only silence Amelia but also send a chilling message to anyone considering joining the Epochist cause.

The gerontocracy's actions had a profound impact on Lena. Witnessing her mother's struggle firsthand, she became more determined than ever to fight against the oppressive system that targeted her family. The deplatforming of Amelia galvanized Lena and other Epochists to ramp up their efforts, uniting them in their shared struggle for a more equitable future.

Despite the gerontocracy's attempts to quash the Epochists' momentum, the deplatforming of Amelia ultimately backfired. It served as a powerful rallying cry, exposing the extent to which the ruling elite were willing to go to maintain their control. As a result, the Epochist movement gained more attention and support, turning Amelia into a symbol of resistance and inspiring others to join the fight for a better future.
