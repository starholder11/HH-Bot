# Phase 2: Agentic Task Sequencing

## Executive Summary

This document defines the implementation sequence for building the agentic system, prioritizing a working vertical slice over comprehensive feature development. The approach focuses on shipping a complete end-to-end workflow quickly, then iterating based on real usage patterns.

The implementation follows a vertical slice approach where Week 4 delivers a complete workflow: natural language request → tool execution → spatial preview → user approval → refinement. This approach minimizes risk by validating core concepts early and enables continuous user feedback to guide development priorities.
