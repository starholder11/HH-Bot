Green Sahara

Prompt: infinite ambience, celestial drone, stock 909 beat, sufi psych violins, low-fi eschatology, simulacra samples

Lyrics:

[Instrumental (arabesque space rock)]
[Pre-Verse]
Sainted pilot on the desert stars
Sainted pilot wandering very far
Across the night desert
Carrying love letters
Across the night desert
He with no betters
[Verse]
Hoopoe herald leading thirty birds
Through seven valleys, sacred words
Mystic valleys burning bright
Valley of love's infinite flight
Through the desert of unknowing
Where the simurgh's truth is showing


[Verse]
call me 
whisper on the wind
offered by 
the desert djinn
I'll promise you the night
I'll promise my delights
but the offer
won't ring true
there's a hollow in the night
a shiver and a fright
as we tumble over dunes
falling out of tune
and I'm sacred as I'm free
lost in captured history
it's hard enough
without the memory
of you
it's hard enough
without the memory
of you
leave me
in the green sahara
sah har ahhhh
sah har ahhhh
[Fade]
[End]
