It's you
Every one of you
All around me I see
Just what we can be
Everyone of you

[Pre-Verse]
It's the time for us to sing
It's the time for us to rise
It's the time
It's the time

[Verse]
To the meadows
the children run
In the summers
when school's out
Do you remember?
How it used to be?
Do you remember
When we were free?
How I crossed the creek
Holding your hand
How skinny we were
When we swam
How we snuck out at night
How we discovered each other
My summers with you
My summers, everyday and you

[Singer Talking]
Now I'm gonna do one and you're gonna do one and we'll go back and forth
[Applause]

[Singer End-Verse]
It's the time for us to sing
It's the time for us to rise
It's the time
It's the time
For these summers
To come back alive
