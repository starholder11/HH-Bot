In The Stereo

prompt:vaporwave timestretch french house remix


[Whispers (stereo panning)]
one day after school
we snuck into the <inaudible>
and they 
trap
trap
trapped
trapped us in the stereo...
stuck here in disco
<wobbles>round and round
we go.

Where are the girls in the stereo?
Which albums make them spin?
