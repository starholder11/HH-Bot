[pre-verse (showroom voice)]
michigan mexico
jelly bean
michigan mexico
jelly bean
real scene
walk on

[Verse (slow delivery)]
hit me with the cool girl too slow
staring me down at the rodeo
hip huggers high risers
pushing up the energy higher
talking about that A team buffalo
hitting that grass as you put on a show
walking that walk talking that talk
making all the young folks
stop and gawk

{Chorus]
I'm walking
walking back
walking
walking back
to you
what we do
yeah what we do

[Verse (slow delivery)]
thinking bout the good times
and how you once rode up on me
that slow grind break my mind
hit me with that every time
what went wrong with us
didn't you tremble to my touch
too much much to good
wanting to take back that 
shoulda could

[Bridge (dramatic build)]
