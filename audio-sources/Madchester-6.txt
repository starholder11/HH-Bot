[Introduction]
[Sampled record featuring trumpets]
((hissing record))
[Deep french house vocal]
It's time to lose it love,
It's time to lose it love
[Rolling baseline]
[Acidhouse groove]
[Downtempo female vocals]
I know you want to be free baby
I know you want out of the box
It's good here baby
Real good here
Walk with me me mee
[Instrumental Bridge]

It's good here baby
Real good here
It's good here baby
Real good here

I think I'm going under
going under
going under
