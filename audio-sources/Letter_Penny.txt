Lyrics:

[Pre-Verse]
Letter Penny
Asteroids
Ontology
See me about a bee
To talk colony collapse
Falling, falling apart.

[Instrumental {soft Trumpet elegy)]

[Verse]
Puzzling
What you said to me
A different person
Than the one I met before
Who should I remind?
To take the dirty laundry
And air it out in town

[Chorus]
Neutral zones
Tax advantaged
I'm offshore
Offshore

[Verse]
Prospectus
Emotional bond debt
Years of regret
packaged up in tranches
layers of romances
Losing sight of you
But that's alright
Let's regroup around tax time
And align ourselves
On how to survive

[Recursive Bridge Reset]


[Verse]
One thing leads to another
and so we discover swap strategies
yet all this time, you're on the side
entering price discovery
just another way to play
all our opportunities
asset classes mind your back strats
I'm providing liquidity
All around town
you know I'm down
parlay my good fortune
to a life beyond prosperity
[Bridge]
[Instrumental]

what are mutual interests
but decisions weighted over time
it slips my mind why I find time 
and then
One thing leads to another
and so we discover swap strategies
yet all this time, you're on the side
entering price discovery
just another way to play
all our opportunities
asset classes mind your back strats
I'm providing liquidity
All around town
you know I'm down
parlay my good fortune
to a life beyond prosperity

[Verse]
Puzzling
What you said to me
A different person
Than the one I met before
Who should I remind?
To take the dirty laundry
And air it out in town

[Chorus]
Neutral zones
Tax advantaged
I'm offshore
Offshore

[End]
