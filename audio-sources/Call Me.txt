Call Me

Prompt: barbiecore bimbo anthem, fast processed female vocal, bubblegum big beat energy

Lyrics:

call me
call me when I'm not at home
call me when I'm off my phone
gone away
for the rest of my life
gone to play
go find a new wife
cause I got over things (other things)
on my mind
I got other things (other things)
that you'd find hard to accept
I got other things
that demand my respect
so call me babes
when I'm not at home
call me all the time
when I'm off my phone
cause I got other things (other things)
to do with my time


call me
call me when I'm not at home
call me bitch when I'm off my phone
gone away
for the rest of my life
gone away
for the rest of my life
gone to play

so call me babes
when I'm not at home
call me all the time
when I'm off my phone
cause I got other things 
to do with my time


Oh, the way we were, like pretty pictures in the frame
Stitched together, a beautiful memory that remains (remains, yeah)
But time moves on, and things change
Yet we'll always have those picture perfect days (oh-oh-oh)

I got other things
that demand my respect
so call me babes
when I'm not at home
call me all the time
when I'm off my phone
cause I got other things (other things)
to do with my time


call me when I'm not at home
call me bitch when I'm off my phone
gone away
for the rest of my life
gone away
for the rest of my life
gone to play

so call me babes
when I'm not at home
call me all the time
when I'm off my phone
cause I got other things 
to do with my time

time (fade out)
