Echoes Of Existence

Prompt: dreamy atmospheric shoegazer

Lyrics:

[Verse]
In the midst of shadows, a boy finds his way
Lost in the realms of philosophical sway
A shack in solitude, where wisdom resides
The old man's words echoing through the tides

[Chorus]
Wanderers crossing paths on a mysterious quest
A sentient kite drone soaring above the crest
As the ocean whispers secrets in the breeze (ooh-yeah)
Echoes of existence whisper through the trees (ooh-yeah)

[Bridge] The silky threads of conversations past Weave a tapestry where meanings cast Into the symphony of a world vast Between boy and sea, a link that will last

[Chorus] Wanderers crossing paths on a mysterious quest A sentient kite drone soaring above the crest As the ocean whispers secrets in the breeze (ooh-yeah) Echoes of existence whisper through the trees (ooh-yeah)

[Outro] As city sky rains down a networked embrace In the slipstream of time, they find their place The shack, the sea, the drone, unite in grace In the echoes of existence, their traces interlace

[Chorus] Wanderers crossing paths on a mysterious quest A sentient kite drone soaring above the crest As the ocean whispers secrets in the breeze (ooh-yeah) Echoes of existence whisper through the trees (fade out)


[Bridge] The silky threads of conversations past Weave a tapestry where meanings cast Into the symphony of a world vast Between boy and sea, a link that will last

[Chorus] Wanderers crossing paths on a mysterious quest A sentient kite drone soaring above the crest As the ocean whispers secrets in the breeze (ooh-yeah) Echoes of existence whisper through the trees (ooh-yeah)

[Outro] As city sky rains down a networked embrace In the slipstream of time, they find their place The shack, the sea, the drone, unite in grace In the echoes of existence, their traces interlace

[Chorus] Wanderers crossing paths on a mysterious quest A sentient kite drone soaring above the crest As the ocean whispers secrets in the breeze (ooh-yeah) Echoes of existence whisper through the trees (fade out)


 of time, they find their place The shack, the sea, the drone, unite in grace In the echoes of existence, their traces interlace

[Chorus] Wanderers crossing paths on a mysterious quest A sentient kite drone soaring above the crest As the ocean whispers secrets in the breeze (ooh-yeah) Echoes of existence whisper through the trees (fade out)
