[POP HISS]
[Thundering low fuzz single guitar riff]
[Silence]
[Whispered Female Voice (on the radio)]
They have all gone to ground
and cleared out from the village
simple folk say the air is infected
that the fever travels on the trade roads
scavage food and move on
I'm heading north but this is my last post
something is following me
and I don't like it
[Isolated guitar riff]
[Crack]
[Ominous building]
[Harmonies]
Gloria, 
in excelsis Deo
et in terra pax homínibus bonæ voluntátis
[Sampled voice loop repeating]
Are there still?
People of good will
Are there still?
People of good will

[Instrumental (featuring lush melodic layered guitars awash in processed feedback with gregorian vocal chanting)]


[Chorus (female layered harmonies)]
I'm on the memorial road
For King Phillips War
Massacrees and monuments
Protestants gone heaven scent
Cotton Mather to Tarrytown
The terror of the Lord
In the wilderness of
the new.

[Computer Terminal Speaking]
Gothic Highlands
Headless at West Point
Irving and his fairytales
Sermons amidst the surreal

[Pre-Verse]
Oh let me
Wear the Scarlett A
Treat exile
as holiday
Blood on the tracks
And Testament as facts
Seems the only way out
Is always through
Don't let them
Run over you.

[Instrumental (featuring lush melodic layered guitars awash in processed feedback with gregorian vocal chanting)]


[Chorus (female layered harmonies)]
I'm on the memorial road
For King Phillips War
Massacrees and monuments
Protestants gone heaven scent
Cotton Mather to Tarrytown
The terror of the Lord
In the wilderness of
the new.
