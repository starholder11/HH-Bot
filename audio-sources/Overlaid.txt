Overlaid

Prompt: new romantic, liquid blue night rock, overlaid future orchestral melody


Lyrics:

[Verse (slick showroom delivery)]
wilshire in december
driving empty nights
doing killer work
contract high on my own supply
heavy hooded dark shades
reflecting the night back out
electric lights soaking in my pulse
I'm hunting you down
you know this

[Chorus (new romantic croon)]
you know its tonight
we settle this
only one can survive

[Bridge]
this collision course of cool

[Chorus]
you know its tonight
we settle this
only one can survive
this collision course of cool

[Verse]
Overlays always linger
that last thing hanging around and around
that's you, that's me, that's the world baby
always one foot in memories
the other hoping to make some more
everything on top of each other
everything knotted up
I'm strung out, stretched across
all these overlays
the moons I obit

[Chorus (new romantic croon)]
circle around me 
as I circle around you
spinning across the ages
twisting ourselves in time
lay yourself over me
as I offer myself to you

[Bridge]

[Chorus (new romantic croon)]
as I offer myself to you

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
you know its tonight
we settle this
only one can survive
this collision course of cool

[Verse]
Cool me down baby
I'm burning up inside
Hold me close baby
It's time we, it's time we
Let it all go
let it all go

[Chorus (new romantic croon)]
circle around me 
as I circle around you
spinning across the ages
twisting ourselves in time
lay yourself over me
as I offer myself to you

{End]

[Chorus (new romantic croon)]
circle around me 
as I circle around you
spinning across the ages
twisting ourselves in time
lay yourself over me
as I offer myself to you

{End]
