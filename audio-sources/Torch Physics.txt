Lyrics:

[Verse (torchy soulful house)]
there's a point at which 
you warp space time baby, 
it's that relativity come true, 
there's a point where 
the gravitational well 
of your desires
crush me to bits,
that the black hole bruise on you, 
there's a point at which 
entropy exhausts
 all the big bang set in motion,
that's what I see in you,
 oh baby you bend the laws of physics 
right around me yes you do
oh yes you do ooh ooh oooh


[Verse (torchy soulful house)]
there's a point at which 
you warp space time baby, 
it's that relativity come true, 
there's a point where 
the gravitational well 
of your desires
crush me to bits,
that the black hole bruise on you, 
there's a point at which 
entropy exhausts
 all the big bang set in motion,
that's what I see in you,
 oh baby you bend the laws of physics 
right around me yes you do
oh yes you do ooh ooh oooh
