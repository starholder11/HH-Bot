Prompt: snarekit, standup bass, slow reverb tremolo guitar, white boy drawl hip hop


kiss me 
in your rattlesnake jacket  
emily calypso
regency bananas
invite me over
for a bottomless brunch
pop a bottle and
pour it in your pump
leather to my lips
bubbles dripping
down me
go ahead and drown me

emily calypso
regency bananas
you never cared
that I'm big in Japan

polished leather stirrups
brass rings in your eyes
warm me up 
with a slow trot
it's raining outside

[Building tempo]

reegency bananas
you never cared
that I'm big in Japan

[Guitar solo (thundering)]

Bought yourself a lemon
burnt peels on the floor
bitters are your aura
no need to say more

key on the carpet
cuffs already latched
I'd call this an impasse
knees are beyond my grasp
lost myself inside you
never coming out
lock me in the stables
its raining outside

emily calypso
reegency bananas
you never cared
that I'm big in Japan
[Fade Out]
