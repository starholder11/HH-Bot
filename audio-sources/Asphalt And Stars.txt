Asphalt and Stars

Prompt: low rock only bass, drums, baritone sax


Asphalt and stars
Rubber and the cosmos
sprawled across the blacktop
ink splattered abstracts
pollocked windshields
scatter gun stop signs
gone is the neon on the off ramp
no more hideaways the blues
heaven help me, 
AM radio take the wheel
Seven signs seven signs
Hundred Eleven miles 
under desert skies
Trackers always asking
after you
