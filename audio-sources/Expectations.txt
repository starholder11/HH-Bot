Expectations


Prompt: dreamtempo,  fuzzy scuzzy lullaby for easy come downs,  recursive indie electro

Lyrics:

city lights flicker, dreams hang
whispers, threads, lost
steel hearts, beat slow, cold

wings of metal, cut sky
patterns written, stars watch
songs without voice, float

breathe, city
nodes, touch
fate written, silent

shadows, bend
tears of silicon
love, in loops

Lyra tells, keys whisper
stories spin, ancient, new
chaos cradled, in her hands

city sighs
we connect
destinies link, on high

tales in her gaze
Starholder, blurred
we soar between bits

art, unfinished
heartbeat, stutters
together, apart

breath of city
we twine
dreams, alive

sighs linger
chasing, echoes
Starholder's embrace
Playground me
