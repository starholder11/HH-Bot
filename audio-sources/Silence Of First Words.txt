Silence of First Words

Prompt: esoteric gothtronica, benedictine mass, choral requiem, manchester goth, yearning raw female acapella



[Intro (low resonant drones merge with fractured whispers, like echoes reverberating through a cavern)]

[Verse 1]
Before the stir, where dark embraced, life lay nestled in silence’s trace.
Titans spun shadows in the breath of void, an invisible dance of existence unalloyed.
Their essence, a symphony beyond form and light, now echoes stolen into finite night.

[Verse 2]
In the chasm, where quiet reigned, the First Speaker’s voice pierced and claimed.
From silence woven, souls were torn, to wander paths where light is born.
An alien sun, a world bereaved, where whispers mourn what they believed.

[Chorus]
Voices once felt 'neath ebon sleep, now cast adrift where mortals weep.
In strange lands where shadows shift, echoes beg the silence to uplift.

[Bridge]
The weight of loss like mist enfolds, its tendrils lace the frayed and cold.
In the fractured hollows of timeless streams, memory claws for forgotten dreams.

[Verse 3]
Forsaken orchestras in whispered halls, lured away by unwritten calls.
To worlds spun out of streaks of dawn, mourning the titans now withdrawn.
Yet silence thrives on what remains—its heartbeats echo, free from chains.

[Outro]
In the quiet depths, where nothing unfolds, the titans’ truth in silence holds.
Their song, a tapestry of mournful flame—of life beyond the spoken name.

[faint note echoes and fades, as silence reclaims the night’s embrace.]
