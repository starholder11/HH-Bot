Arbitrary Writs of Royal Courts

prompt: ragga phonk, glitch shock, electro house, psychedelic exotica, codeine paydays



[Announcer (british broadcasting voice)]
I ask that all society
Gather up what courage
Lay there on the shattered ground
And hold it tight to your hearts
So that we may once again
throw the best fucking
block party
in kushy heath
[Instrumental (glitch)(heavy fx)]
[Bridge (tropical lounge)]
Staring down the deadline
On a time share mortgage extension
Ten zombie slurpies
A dozen adderall
Buy now pay later
Buy now fade haters
I've given in
Since you ghosted me
Phasers off stun
Escalating hit and runs
No daylight
Expired visas
Faking seizures
My identity a series 
of claims
just decrement my credit
until I materialize a new identity.
