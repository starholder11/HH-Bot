Vampiric Health

Prompt: tropical goth, glitchcore, hyperpop dubstep

Lyrics:

[Jarring Intro]

[Verse]
they put chips inside your eyes
recording all you see
even as you sleep
do chips dream 
of reflections that you see
a collide a scope
antennas phoning home
I was once alive
On a Tuesday 
walking down the lee side
of a volcano
through switchblade grass
thinking this can't last
only to die a thousandth time
I taste like vodka soda inside
I'm so behind the times
that I flat circle around myself
here's to vampiric health
besides rising from the dead
I ponder my old poetry
to see traces of the soul
that never formed

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
[Tempo Shift Bedlam]

[Chorus]
Call me bedlam
Rocking Straitjacket
Casual wear

[Verse]
I hit the highs
And the lows
On a flat line
Feelings are behind me
I need to be reminded
To fake my relations
Because like the dead
One thing they still unite against
is a sociopath, I need a pathway
to passing as normal in unstable times
Helps with the climb
Not that I care except to survive
they raise the rates, rob us blind
I'm in a taxi, that revolutionary
Call it praxis, denying access to 
the ride shares. I'm off location
A mental vacation that I find 
suits my mind

[Verse]
they put chips inside your eyes
recording all you see
even as you sleep
do chips dream 
of reflections that you see
a collide a scope
antennas phoning home
I was once alive
On a Tuesday 
walking down the lee side
of a volcano
through switchblade grass
thinking this can't last
only to die a thousandth time
I taste like vodka soda inside
I'm so behind the times
that I flat circle around myself
here's to vampiric health
besides rising from the dead
I ponder my old poetry
to see traces of the soul
that never formed


[Verse]
when I smile for myself
I'm a joker, real al roker
the forecast for today
is what we call good foreplay
I'm beside myself
I can't help myself
Or help you, but how do you do?
Expression of concern
Are what I'm best at with a vacant stare
And my head aside, while I'm beside (eye eye eye yeah)
and how I let it ride
it's as if I care and that's
the secret to vampiric health

[Chorus]
Chips inside your
eyes eyes eyes
Collide ide ide ide
Let it ride ride ide
All this time eye eye immmeeeee
A flat circle all around me
All around me

[Instrumental]
