Dream of Reflections

Prompt: tropical glitch goth,Â deep shoegazer

Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse (haunting ethereal)]
they put chips inside your eyes
recording all you see
even as you sleep
do chips dream 
of reflections that you see
a collide a scope
antennas phoning home
I was once alive
On a Tuesday 
walking down the lee side
of a volcano
through switchblade grass
thinking this can't last
only to die a thousandth time
I taste like vodka soda inside
I'm so behind the times
that I flat circle around myself
here's to vampiric health
besides rising from the dead
I ponder my old poetry
to see traces of the soul
that never formed

[Break]
[Bridge]

[IPre-Verse]
Send me to bedlam
Put me on the path to Plath
Oh what I'd do 
for mother's little helper
Tell me the disorder
And I'll pantomime today

[Chorus]
Here's to vampiric health
Here's to vodka in my veins
Here's to dead inside
As a way to be alive

[Verse]
I hit the highs
And the lows
On a flat line
Feelings are behind me
I need to be reminded
To fake my relations
Because like the dead
One thing they still unite against
is a sociopath, I need a pathway
to passing as normal in unstable times
Helps with the climb
Not that I care except to survive
they raise the rates, rob us blind
I'm in a taxi, that revolutionary
Call it praxis, denying access to 
the ride shares. I'm off location
A mental vacation that I find 
suits my mind
