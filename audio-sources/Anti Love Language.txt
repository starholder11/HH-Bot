Anti Love Language

Prompt:a chopped and screwed dub-influenced sub-bass treatment to music that fuses hypnotic Colombian cumbia and champeta rhythms with massive dub sub-bass drops, Layer organic percussion (hand drums, maracas) with crisp electronic beats, Add sparse, echo-drenched vocals floating in reverb clouds, Mix traditional Colombian instrumentation (accordion, gaita flutes) that suddenly dissolve into digital glitches, Maintain a danceable groove while experimental electronic elements create moments of beautiful disorientation, The result should feel like a tropical soundsystem broadcasting from the future


[Pre-Verse (whispered longing)
safety is anti-love
safe words are 
anti-language
love is not safe
until we are 
anti-language



[Verse]
up above it all and oh so lonely
disconnected from reality
if only....why can't you call?
why don't you write
this porch is a prison
you exiled me 
to a hill station
in the cloud forests
of Kampuchea 
I long for you
In the rainy season,
memories make due
but I need a reason
to think you'll come back

[Dancehall Verse]
treacherous communications
cutting us all down
clandestine cells
compromised by spies
safe words are anti-language
no one can speak plainly
any thought I have of you
must be ciphered 
or they'll read me
then hunt you down
I cannot live if love
is just a point of leverage
How do I....
Find my way back to you

safety is anti-love,
safe words are 
anti-language,
love is not safe,
until we are 
anti-language.
