Audrey

Prompt; loud quiet loud in folkdrone shoegazer, large lo-fi experimental bedroom recordings, rural psychedelica spacerock, looped and layered as melodic feedback


[Computer Terminal Speaking]
Special Agent,
Special Agent,
It's Audrey on the line
We need some damn good coffee
And a slice of cherry pie.

[Spaghetti Western Instrumental]

[Pre-Verse]
Who's afraid of the Great Northern?
With their saddle shoes and evil horns
Something's Troubling

[Soaring Harmony]
What do the owls know?
Where do they fly?
The lodge goes somewhere
Beyond the great divide

[Verse]
What if love is not enough?
To tame the trouble in the night
What if love is not enough?
To keep the dark away.
Strike a match, tend the light
Take a drag and shake the fright
Nothing else to do 
but be
 the light all others see

[Bridge (moody foggy guitars awash in processed feedback)]

[Pre-Verse]
Sitting at the tee vee is an invitation to love


[Verse]
Come on up to the big log
By the old train station and watch
Ed and Norma carried the torch
for all of those years
and now they tie the knot
Everywhere we look is an invitation to love
Ask anybody and that's all we want
In this strange fated world
the simplest thing to do
is listen with our heart

[Soaring Harmony]
What do the owls know?
Where do they fly?
The lodge goes somewhere
Beyond the great divide

[Soaring Harmony]
Strike a match, tend the light
Take a drag and shake the fright
Nothing else to do 
but be
 the light all others see
[Fade slowly]
