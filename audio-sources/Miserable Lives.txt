Lyrics:


v2
[Intro Verse]
Come in
Come in
Come on
Baby

[Verse]
Candy pop, in the shop
Sell me dreams
Sell me schemes
What's the pathway to you heart?
Cause I got nothing to lose
Absolutely nothing to lose
And you know what matter we choose
It's all just a dead end future

[Chorus]
So let's have
Let's have 
A ball tonight
You'll never look brighter
I'll never get higher
Let's make the most of it baby
There's nothing to save me
So make the most of it now
Let's make the most of it right now


[Chorus]
Let's make the most of it baby
There's nothing to save me
So make the most of it now
Let's make the most of it right now

[Verse]
I can feel us vibing strong baby
you know you're driving me crazy
there's so much you and I can do
before the night is through (oooh ooooh oooh)
I don't care a bit about tomorrow
that's where I'm storing my sorrows
tonight tonight before this is all through
let's make the memories that carry us through
the rest of our miserable lives
the rest of our miserable lives 
eye yie yie yeah yeeah yeeah
eye yie yie yeah yeeah yeeah

[Keytar Solo]

[Chorus]
Let's make the most of it baby
There's nothing to save me
So make the most of it now
Let's make the most of it right now
tonight tonight before this is all through
let's make the memories that carry us through
the rest of our miserable lives
the rest of our miserable lives 

[End]
