Black and Blue

Prompt: downtempo, disco, march, sultry female torch singer

Lyrics:

[Verse]
this is a song, for all the things gone wrong
between you and me
our language has always been incomplete
leaving me to compete with a notion of 
how it should be for everyone except for 
you and me

[Chorus]
What's wrong with us
Is what's right about us
You know it's true
We like it black and blue

[Build]

[Verse]
An army of me verse an army of you
So much to do, when we destroy ourselves
To live together
I wouldn't change a thing
for the pain you bring
is what gets me through

[Chorus]
What's wrong with us
Is what's right about us
You know it's true
We like it black and blue

[Build]

[Verse]
I'm a model UN, you are the world's fair
Both are ridiculous and that's how we compare
What it is we do, to all those silly notions of how
two people should get on with their lives together

[Chorus]
What's wrong with us
Is what's right about us
You know it's true
We like it black and blue

[Refrain]
[End]

[End]
