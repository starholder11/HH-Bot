Lyrics:


v2
[Verse]
Summoner of small chaos
Disrupter of household gods
I will stand opposed
to you intentions
I will fight against
Overwhelming odds

[Verse]
Everything is as it should be
There are no messes 
Under this domain
Disorder is not welcome here

[Chorus]
Rage cleaning uber alles
Fierce dusting rules the day
Step back and admire
The Shine
OH HOW WE SHINE

[Verse]
Summoner of small chaos
Disrupter of household gods
I will stand opposed
to you intentions
I will fight against
Overwhelming odds

[Verse]
Everything is as it should be
There are no messes 
Under this domain
Disorder is not welcome here

[Chorus]
Rage cleaning uber alles
Fierce dusting rules the day
Step back and admire
The Shine
OH HOW WE SHINE

[Pre-chorus]
Everything is as it should be
There are no messes 
Under this domain
Dirt is not welcome here

[Chorus]
Rage cleaning uber alles
Fierce dusting rules the day
Step back and admire
The Shine
OH HOW WE SHINE

[End]
