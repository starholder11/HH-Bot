Late State Of Grace

Prompt: new romantic, vaporwave, chopped and screwed, shoegazer

Lyrics:


v3
Hands on the boardwalk
October crisp, sun warm
Thrift flannels barefoot
As we make our way
Down to the beach

Freckles on shoulders
Knee ripped jeans
Red is the letter
More pictures of you

Time spilling sideways
The days heroic at times
Indian Summer
Late state of grace

Our Lady Forgotten
Mistress Neglected
Come along with thee
Lets walk across the sea

Radiation rules this nation
Deep Water Collapse 
But we're above this now
Long since past
We've long since past

[Intro]

[Verse]
Hands on the boardwalk
October crisp, sun warm
Thrift flannels barefoot
As we make our way
Down to the beach

Freckles on shoulders
Knee ripped jeans
Red is the letter
More pictures of you

Time spilling sideways
The days heroic at times
Indian Summer
Late state of grace

Our Lady Forgotten
Mistress Neglected
Come along with thee
Lets walk across the sea

Radiation rules this nation
Deep Water Collapse 
But we're above this now
Long since past
We've long since past
