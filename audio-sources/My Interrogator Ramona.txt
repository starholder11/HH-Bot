Agent Echo authorizing signal
You are live for fire.
[Scorching deep guitar riff]
[Sampled voice loop repeating]
Copy, I'm live for fire.
Copy, I'm live for fire.
Live for fire.

Of me and you oooh

Coming from inside my mind
A shimmer
Inside my mind
Are my thoughts
Echoing out?
I must not betray myself
