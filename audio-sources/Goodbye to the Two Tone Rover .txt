Goodbye to the Two Tone Rover

prompt: the sound of the UK in the early eighties incorporating elements of mod music, blue eyed soul, afrobeat from a  two tone ska revival band expanding their repertoire to craft more complex and nuanced emotionally charged sophistipop music


[Pre-Verse]
Oh my darling (ooh ooh ooh)
Yes my darling (ooh ooh ooh)
Walking in the market
Arm in arm, oh so sweet
You and me, just meant to be
heh heh
[Quick Bridge]

[Verse]
There's a time to stop and look around
Take stock of where we are
And what we've done
A time to just sit back ask
Ask ask ask
If the time has come to settle down
And make a little home of our own
Oh I know I know I know oh oh ohhh
How hard it was growing up
The fighting and the chaos every night
Arguing over everything
No one ever winning anything
Wondering about the next paycheck
The pressure so heavy on their neck
the dole man's shame
and parish pantry
And here we are playing Sid and Nancy
baby baby babyeeee


[Chorus]
Your Momma didn't know better
But she didn't raise a fool
My Poppa was never home
Just means I want to be around
Let's put the past behind us babe
I think, oooh
YES, I think
It's time we settled down

[Verse]
Everyone here is...Oh so busy
Running wild in terminal city
Lots of work, lots to do
Imma hustling man 
No one's smarter than youuuu 
oooh oooh ooh
Put that together
We'll beat any weather
Baby my dancehall days are over
Say goodbye to the two toned rover
It's time to settle down
and put our coins in the ground
you know it's true
Be my bride and let's 
Skank on down the aisle

[Chorus]
Your Momma didn't know better
But she didn't raise a fool
My Poppa was never home
Just means I want to be around
Let's put the past behind us babe
I think, oooh
YES, I think
It's time we settled down
Tonight let's start a new life
In Terminal City
[Instrumental (lovers rock bridge out)]
