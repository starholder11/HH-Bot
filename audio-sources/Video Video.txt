Lyrics:

[Introduction]
(gunshots)
(V8 engine revving)
(tires squealing + glitch stutter effect)
[Break]
(smooth morning deejay voice) "It's the top of the hour on the hot box and boy we got a box of rock for you"
(8-bit arcade sound)
[Pre-Verse]
(bratty chanting, multiple layers with vocoder)
Get us on the
Video, Video
Put us on the
TV, TV

[Chorus]
(post-punk flat male voice, slight pitch down)
Where You Can See Me
As I wait for you,
ooh ooh ooh ooh
(bass wobble intensifies)
Watching the Tee Vee
As I'm all alone
yeah heh heh haaah
(glitch transition, crushed bits)
[Instrumental]
(jagged staccato guitar )
(bass drop)
[Verse 1]
(ska delivery)
Hi jack the stereo
From your baby bro's
Bad excuse for disco
no oh oh oh
Tonight it's two tone
yeah it's two tone
whoah oh oh
Jamming on this side
shaking my bony
derrière
without a care
care care care care
[Pre-Verse Reprise]
(bratty chanting + pitch-shifted backup vocals)
Get us on the
Video, Video
Put us on the
TV, TV
(slot machine sounds)
[Chorus]
(post-punk voice + vocoded harmonies)
Where You Can See Me
As I wait for you,
ooh ooh ooh ooh
(synth electroclash swell)
Watching the Tee Vee
As I'm all alone
yeah heh heh haaah
(processed vocals glitching between octaves)
system error beep
kawaii ringtone fragment
corrupted game sound
hall and oats glitch
cat video sample
windows_95_error dot wave
While empires crash
our ice cream truck 
jingle corrupts to static
[Bridge]
(robotic voice, heavily processed)
System overload
Over load, 
Over and Over
Load
Code Red
Critical


[Pre-Verse]
(cute female deejay) "It's the top of the hour on the hot box and HONEY we got your new addiction right here. LITERALLY cannot wait to share this with you bestie. Like actually the MOST insane thing you'll hear today. Not even kidding, this is going to break your entire brain. And I mean that in like the most respectful way possible? (giggles) Just wait for it babes... wait for it... OKAY HERE WE GO
[Stop]
[End]


[Pre-Verse (selector)]
Hotwire
Your Nintendo Switch
Hook it up
With a big bong hit
Activate the cheat code
fill both chambers
and unload
on the video, video
Luigi is my tv, tv
Until I outta lives
let's fucking go
[Sound FX (glitchcore dancehall)
