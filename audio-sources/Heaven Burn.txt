prompt:chopped and screwed, pitch change time stretch, disco drill downtempo, voix f√©minine, found sounds, wobble



[Intro (plaintive singing)]
gosh, the drip of rain
kah plunk plunk plunks
filling the bucket
drop by drop
and tomorrow
when the sun comes out
I'll pick the pail 
and carry it up
to the garden
of the gods

[Chorus]
I got heaven burn
all up my arms, and
eyes peeled back
ready to bloom
but you always look away

[Verse]
Shy boy, born too soon
hardly noticed
but I, I see you
when you don't see me
and how?
can we pass apart
not even false starts
something between us
means nothing becomes us

[Chorus]
I try to live
in the world 
as it is
cuz the world
I want to be
pains to think about

[Pre-Verse]
the gaze of god
burning into me
all that can be seen
except possibility
of you and me

[Instrumental (deep bass wobble)]
[Announcer (sampled voice)]
kah plunk plunk plunk
boo hoo moo you
all the thoughts
fall down
all the thoughts
fall down
[Bridge]
[Pre-Verse]
Rain, rain, rain
Falling all around me
And the boy sits
On his porch
Unable to see
That I'm his destiny
