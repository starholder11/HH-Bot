Cherry Cart Lane

prompt: loud quiet loud in folkdrone shoegazer, large lo-fi experimental bedroom recordings, rural psychedelica spacerock, looped and layered as melodic feedback


[Fade In (backwards masked droning melodic guitars)]
[Vocals building from whisper]
Don't ever go down the cherry cart lane
It's not fit for walking they say
Bad things happen
But don't they happen everywhere?
Just like good things do too.
I bet there are good things
down the cherry cart lane

[Shimmering processed looping guitars]
[Spoken word (girlish voice)]
And so he went up to live in the trees
Because of something his father said
Everyone thought the little baron would come down
But he found his world up in the trees
So he stayed for such a long time
And traveled so far making friends along the way
[Instrumental (featuring lush melodic layered guitars awash in processed feedback)}

[Chorus (layered female vocoders harmonizing)]
The boy up in the trees
Met the cherry cart girl
They were worlds away
But Never Far Apart
Now it's you and me
Spring blossom 
cherry trees
this my dear
this my dear
Was Meant To Be
