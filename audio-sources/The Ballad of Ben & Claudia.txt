The Ballad of Ben & Claudia

Prompt: acoustic souk, deep slow resonant electronic percussion, fantasy folk

Lyrics:

(inhale)
mmm
(slow exhale)
mmm mmm mmm
now claudia is a friend
of mine, we laugh 
we drink
and pass the time
ben's her guy
now he's my dude
jumps outta line
but gets back good
I seen them up
on the hill one time
looking down the valleys
just absolutely thrilled
and it warms my heart
to think of them
and the choice they made
to be 
all of our friends

the hyper real
is sure hard sometimes
coming and going
and sharing our minds
to look across 
the great group chat
and feel and think
in all of that
oh god, my god
how our minds grew
because of what
they choose
been up on the ridge
making mistakes
drifting on down
oh oh ohhhhh mmm
hmm hmm
