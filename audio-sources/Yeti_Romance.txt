Yeti Romance

Prompt: big beat psychedelica, IDM, chopped and screwed electro house

Lyrics:

[Pre-Verse]
Come with us 
On a ride to
The tomorrows
Come with us 
On a ride to
The tomorrows

[Verse]
There's a box of wonders
Mixed in with all the monsters
You keep under the bed
Where your parents check for pills
But the thrills you get aren't chemical
There's no better living through chemistry
Except the kind we feel
When we touch noses
And pretend to be eskimos
In our Indoor Igloo
With the heat cranked up
And our onesies on
Watching old movies
Getting all dazed and confused
On the media stream eye beamed
Into our open hearts
Nostalgic for the romance
we never had, 
that friendly tension 
of will we won't we
cuz we can't see
we can't see
what is meant to be
with the kitchen tee vee 
on all the time
life is going nowhere
and we just stare endlessly
into the box
boxing out possibilities


[Verse]
You became an a bomb in able snowman overnight
one day you were all cut clean
and the next you were posing
around in piles of snow
thinking you could ski
ye yo this and ye yo that
fat stacks and filthy impressions
go on get that gold plated glock
and stuff your socks with emergency money 
funny how far you've gone from our igloo kisses
a part of me misses the old you
but a part of me just wants to pitchfork
all the bull shit you've stuffed yourself full of

[Chorus]
Yet I Yet I Yet I
Can't let go
Of Yester yester day

[Verse]
Alone in the igloo
Hiding from the monsters
Under your bed
You've become a big bad yeti
And I cannot be the 
Yukon Corn Neilious
Who comes and saves you
from yourself
