Merge With Time

prompt: baroque psychedelic acide pop, laurel canyon sound


[Verse 1]
In the gentle drift where time forgets its pace,
colors blend like dreams, floating through space.
We sail where horizons embrace the sky—
a melody of time, a lullaby.

[Verse 2]
Waves of thought breathe in the cosmic sea,
where the past and future play in harmony.
Moments curve through starlit days,
in a tapestry of life, an endless sway.

[Chorus]
Let’s merge with time, where echoes sing,
in an ocean of sound where we’re everything.
With each refrain, the universe reveals
the beauty of the unseen, the love we feel.

[Bridge]
Harmony weaves through celestial night,
as constellations guide us with gentle light.
Every note a whisper in the expanse,
a journey unfolding, a cosmic dance.

[Verse 3]
In the soft embrace of the eternal flow,
we find treasures in the depths below.
Listen where the silence holds its sway,
hear the time as it guides our way.

[Outro]
With the stars as our symphony, we glide—
a voyage timeless beneath the tide.
In the harmony of the spheres, we find
a connection beyond the bounds of time.

[gentle harmonies fade, drifting into an expansively serene horizon.]
