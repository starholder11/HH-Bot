Elephant Hole

Prompt:chopped and screwed electro sub bass hyperpop


[Pre-Verse (Raspy Haunted Vocals)]
Set me up another round of sorrows
All interconnected til the edge of tomorrow
Linen suit man with the leather bag blues
Unlicensed cash courier with time to kill

[Verse (jamiacan roots)]
Why you see my dollar guy
Smile, and ask him why...
I cannot retire
Til the edge
Of Tomorrow
At the Bay
Of Deep Sorrows

[Chorus]
Enclave special economic zone
Supply chains, automated drones
Miss Banana out front
Fascist in the back
Smedley Butlering
Full stack
[Verse - Feverish Stream of Consciousness]
Sweat-dripping telex machine clicking codes through embassy walls corporate ghosts digital trails dissolve in acid rain FCPA phantoms stalking through back channels while I'm caught in crossfire compliance-man junkie law-sick shivering under palms five layers of shell companies interzone cutouts faceless men in tropical wool sweating through redactions yachting parties where nameless bureaucrats interface with CIA station chiefs dictator's bagman with Harvard credentials funneling kickbacks through Swiss tunnels economic hit-men leaving tracks in digital sand corporate assassins with accounting degrees no fixed moral position JUST BUSINESS documents shredded in real-time while diplomatic cables scream contradictions into the void five-star generals moonlighting as board members offshore entity nexus points blurring regulatory boundaries black-site accounting practices untraceable briefcases unmarked helicopter pads where NASDAQ meets jungle law FCPA jurisdiction smeared across time zones like a hallucination melting in the heat reality distortion field where third-world governance meets first-world extraction zonerunner compliance officer mainlining loopholes through system architecture while algorithms track bribes disguised as consulting fees quantum uncertainty principle applied to regulatory enforcement NOTHING IS FIXED nothing solid everything liquid asset stripped realities where even the enforcers are compromised Liminal space between law and lawlessness where power determines truth and truth determined by profit matrix

Drop the bag
In the Elephant Hole tonight
Fill a big bag
Only cash is accepted on sight
Elephant ain't got no soul
Leaves a big hole
Where the money goes
