Lyrics:

[Intro (norteno horns with big beats)]

[Pre-Verse (hazy lazy repititive mantra)]
I had a sueno
Of Senior Dylan
Staggering in the streets
I had a sueno 
Oh such a dream 
That Bob would write it down
A dream in which dylan stalked mexico
As an NPC performing field research
For a thousand gigolo bars of songs
Sweet and wicked melodies of dreams
That happened down in old mexico

[Drastic change to disco]

[Chorus]
Sweet sweet suenos
Of Senoritas and gigalos
Bell bottom baby mommas
Working hips, talking quick
Cause the sitter needs them home


[Chorus]
Sweet sweet suenos
Of Senoritas and gigalos
Bell bottom baby mommas
Working hips, talking quick
Cause the sitter needs them home

[bridge]

[Verse]
You, you always got the best of me
And what about the rest of me
left like meetings on a monday morn
come out storming I'm always hoping
this can be something so much more

[Tempo Change]

[Verse (male rapper)]
my my my gigolo lies
stagger free stagger lee
dylan characters puppeted
by lyric and verse, well rehearsed
the cadence and the flow
the melange so merry
the characters so low
and in between the tale to tell
always romeo and juliet
and a man down on his luck
far away is good, better on the road
in the boundary zones between
that's where it happens see
holed up mid scene looking rough
feeling betrayed or doubting one's sense
same thing in the end, same thing
call them friend

[Chorus]
Sweet sweet suenos
Of Senoritas and gigalos
Bell bottom baby mommas
Working hips, talking quick
Cause the sitter needs them home

[Verse (call and response)]
Mister Bobby?
Yes Senora?
Oh Mister Bobby!
Si, Senorita
Write me like those bad poets
The drunks and the slavers
Who lost the light of genius
and wandered tortured
the cobblestones of oaxaca
in their own silent processions
forbidden to seek confession
carrying the crosses 
no one could bare
