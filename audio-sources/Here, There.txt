Here, There

prompt: loud quiet loud in folkdrone shoegazer, large lo-fi experimental bedroom recordings, rural psychedelica spacerock, looped and layered as melodic feedback

[Verse]
You come to me when in season
Summer boy you tell your girlfriends
Pose me against my neighbors farm stand
Laugh and ask where have we been?
[Chorus]
Here, we are always right here
There, is a place for folks like you
Don't think I don't see through
The condescending point of view
[Verse]
I get asked why I do it
Trot around and be directed
It ain't class, It ain't a lack of self esteem
It's that you're shit, but novel too
Yeah, I look back down on you too
A clash of point of views
Beats repeating the same half dozen
Other lovers we all cycle through
[Chorus]
Here, we are always right here
There, is a place for folks like you
Don't think I don't see through
The condescending point of view
[Guitar solo / Feedback freak]
[Verse]
And I'll trade notes with the next
Whose pics you'll share with your bests
I'll tell him how to push your buttons
And where to touch and the secret switch
That shuts you up, there's a dossier on you
Don't think about your upper hand
Or that you got a master plan
We're both just someone new
Different conversations to pass the time
while we drive cuz there's nothing else to do
[Shimmering processed looping guitars]
[Chorus]
Here, we are always right here
There, is a place for folks like you
Don't think I don't see through
The condescending point of view
