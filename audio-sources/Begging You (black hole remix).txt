Lyrics:

[Pleading Verse]
Calling calling out to you
Falling falling far from grace
Catch me catch me if you dare
Help me help me see my face
I'm all out of patience
For everything I've done
I'm all out of patience
For everything I've become
There's a hole inside of me
That never can be filled

[Impassioned Chorus]
You can
Save me from myself
Come on
Save me from myself
Be my big bang
Babe, I'm begging you
Begging you (ooh ooh ooh)
