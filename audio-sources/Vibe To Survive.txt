Vibe To Survive

Prompt:Lush dreamy shoegaze textures with dense reverb-washed guitars float over propulsive, anthemic drums and soaring synths in the verses, The chorus blooms into rich ensemble vocals and glimmering pads, then melts into a groovy acid yacht rock bridge with bright keys, wah guitar, and a steady funk-inflected bass, The outro layers ethereal synths and swirling effects, fading on a sea of ambient textures



hip cats with their backyard marg pitchers
land yachts beached by the barbecue
is it porch fest or the fourth of july?
what are we celebrating besides being alive?

the suns out and she's ozempic fit
still too soon to get her face lift
it's my week, split custody of the dogs
california sober and calling rover on over

we got the duffy boat full on charge
jungle cruising the canals 
bumping de barge
this is the rhythm of the night
and everything's all right
it's life after the last chopper out

all my options cashed
so I refinanced divorce
turn it to starboard
and chart a new course
vibe to survive

I used to be a freeway lizard
caught up in a commuting blizzard
covid came and we worked from home
after that I was free to roam

there was nothing on my end ever
skipped deliverables 
and made teams miserable
zero interest, yet won the lottery
met a girl, and got into pottery

it's life after the last chopper out
it's life after the last chopper out

we got the duffy boat full on charge
jungle cruising the canals 
bumping de barge
this is the rhythm of the night
and everything's all right
it's life after the last chopper out
