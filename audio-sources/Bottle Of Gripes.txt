Bottle of Gripes

prompt: celtic marching snare, bag pipes, rousing female vocalist, country irish like we used to do


Bartender,
A bottle of
your finest gripes
from the region of agrippa
It's time to
turn up the house lights
and draw a curtain
over all the illusions.

Pencil me in
for the next merry go round
I'll surely ride
the very next pony
they trot out

Next time, I want a longer con
Neither big, nor strong
but the slow come on
wrapped in riddles 
that withdraw when touched
that's such a rush
I'd rather something stupid
that requires me to pursue.

Hey there, what about us?
We once touched
The way lovers do.

Go on, pour another glass
the bubbles they're trapped
and freedom seems 
like the right thing to do.

Your eyes are sharper than knives
At least you're alive
Like a kick from a mule
Or the crack of a slap
On my backside.

I'm alright with the mean
Doesn't bother me
I once grew up hard
I once wasn't seen
You ain't nothing
I haven't already handled

Too bad you're so beaten down
I'm not so good with 
picking people back up
but maybe it'll be different
this time around

care to join me
in a round of gripes?
your cause could be mine
lets merge our quarrels
and combine

I bet you get
a great many
propositions
I'm upfront
far too blunt
but I could con you
for such a long time
such a long time.
