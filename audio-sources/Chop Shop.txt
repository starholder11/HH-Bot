Chop Shop

Prompt: chop shop, gltich thump, bottomless bounce

Lyrics:

[Intro (hype)]
In the shop, shop shop
feel that hop hop hop
about to drop drop drop
shop hop drop
shop hop drop (echo)
[Slow motion voice]
shopppppp
dropppppp
hopppppp
[Verse (hustle flow)]
Send it all to zero in a saucer off my rocker grammy tik tokker flocka seagulls feeble evil climb the stepple made of marshmellow oh he such a harsh fellow I'm calling on my counterparts in corporate underpants and body rock to give me that linked in networked talk and i'm off to spot but I forgot the thing about the ooctonauts teasing teamwork as the solution to all in life that troubles you count on cute to smother you in platitudes to see you through the most basic of our bitches brew
[Instrumental (berserker beatdrop)]
In the shop, shop shop
feel that hop hop hop
about to drop drop drop
shop hop drop
shop hop drop (echo)
[Slow motion voice]
shopppppp
dropppppp
hopppppp
