Bossanova

Prompt:intelligent dance torch music

hands are dealt
she likes the feel of felt
her polish
color in my eyes

tumbling dice
splashing chips
its monte carlo night

special lady
what's love go to do?
blow on them for luck
holding out for hips

settling for crisps
pints
our lady of blessed charity
devoted sons, honored in the war
well, let well, let well enough alone
