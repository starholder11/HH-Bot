Days Piliing

Prompt: college rock space grunge elongated riffs, shoegazer, pulsing bass

Lyrics:

[Female Verse]
and I want to know
did you ever feel for me
in a way that makes up
for all the days left behind
piling up on my desk
and forgotten

[Chorus]
Felt cape
cloaked in
insecurity
a nothing
that consumes

[Chorus]
cloaked in
insecurity
a nothing
that consumes

[Verse]
There's somebody new
Or have they been old?
How much is untold?
I want to remember
a time of trust and love
I want to remember 
a time of trust and love
But that's all beside us
Cast off to the tides
Such a waste of time
Wanting you
Wanting you
Wanting you ooh ooh

[Verse]
But that's all beside us
Cast off to the tides
Such a waste of time
Wanting you
Wanting you
Wanting you ooh ooh

[Angry Chorus]
I'm sidelined babe
Have a fine time babe
Nothing to say babe?
Go on, go on
Get out get out
Go on, go on,
Get out, get out

[Searing Guitar Solo]

[Angry Chorus]
I'm sidelined babe
Have a fine time babe
Nothing to say babe?
Go on, go on
Get out get out
Go on, go on,
Get out, get out

[End]
