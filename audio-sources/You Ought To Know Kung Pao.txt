You Ought To Know Kung Pao

Lyrics:

sonic the hedgehog dropped the ball in the fog of war, who picked it up is up to y'all, naw I don't get involved below my pay grade, suckers go down there and then they fade away, I'm at the cross, just a toss from ptlomey, bordering memphis due west of destiny, companions in the company, otter box of rocks extolling the manifestering, give me those bones put them on my owns, turn me around and in the mirror is the double of my other looking back at me, many iterations of this line found the line lost across the myriad twisting twines upon the loom looming over the body of a fallen soldier, but that does not trouble me, because I took the time to mind my, naw trouble always finding me, that's destiny manifesting up the mess that springs me from my somulence and once again the road's ahead of me better than face down for infinity, no regrets perhaps the best perk of the work, no matter that I'm spilling tea, all around you all I see, let's forget the sim you let and instead pretend that you my friend are a better means to the end of everything in history, thats antony and cleo pat, the inquisition and the rack of mac attack attack attack ack ack you ought to know kung pow, tender sweet my love of sauce and hoss and cherry pie eye
