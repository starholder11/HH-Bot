Lyrics:

[Showroom Verse]
the selected ascend the stairs
the selected depend on mentioned stares
five eyes on 
nine lives gone
nice try don
heaven bound undress the wounds
flex those scars tell me your story
how did they carve it? 
get all gory gory halelujah
they feng shui'ed you up
dragon door cut clean
cauterized traumatized 
ascend on up
climb higher kid higher
the air passing through you
dark neutrinos rushing through
what's left of you
what a mess they made of my boy
go on give god my regards
gory gory hallelujah


[Showroom Verse]
the clown college casino calling you 
my boy crossing over
an anointed angel of 
re re repressive tolerance
feel taller as they lift you up just like lizzo
they gonna use all those things 
the kids laughed at you about
they gonna use the story of your pain
you know this, you're their son now
they gonna squeeze that pain
package it up all slick
put you on some ellen trip
gory gory hal leh lu jah
my son is selling out
now he's the special one

[Showroom Chorus]
fly high birdie boy
fly high anointed one
you're an untapped market
waiting to erupt

[Showroom Verse]
Gory gory hallelujah 
Jericho Jones got the jubilee
running right through the dragon door
my son is moving moving on
they lift him up so he do no wrong

[Showroom Chorus]
fly high birdie boy
fly high anointed one
fly high birdie boy
fly high anointed one

[End]
