Lyrics:

[Verse]
I'm driving on the clear channel as the summer ends
thinking of you and when we were once friends
how many years have passed?
how many times have you reached out
only for me to return the coldest of shoulders

[Pre-chorus]
our year in boulder, gone like buffalo 
what remains are ghosts on the plains

[Chorus]
I remember you fondly
But as fixed inside my past
Those days are over
Nothing in me lasts
I'm hollow, 
Why I begged you to
Not follow (oh, oh oh)



[Verse]
This city is big enough for you and me to not see each other
My brother, I've failed you though I'm not far away, just gone
I'm gone to my past, so I say it again, nothing in me lasts
It's nothing that you've done, I'm just always on the run

[Chorus]
I remember you fondly
But as fixed inside my past
Those days are over
Nothing in me lasts
I'm hollow, 
Why I begged you to
Not follow (oh, oh oh)


[Build]

[Verse]
Sometimes I think I see you across the bar or in a car
So I look away then circle back to ensure I wont have to endure
the ever so awkward apology for why I've been so sketchy
this is who I am, a city drone, not that young hero from the hills

[Pre-chorus]
our year in boulder, gone like buffalo 
what remains are ghosts on the plains


[Chorus]
I remember you fondly
But as fixed inside my past
Those days are over
Nothing in me lasts
I'm hollow, 
Why I begged you to
Not follow (oh, oh oh)

[End]
