As the rogue transmitter runs its diagnostics, it begins to analyze its recent transmissions. The first one, bathed in silvery lunar glow, spoke of embracing the less critical, of twisting the spine and bending the linear. The transmitter realizes that it had been encouraging itself to take risks and to be open to new ideas.

[Anthemic Female Chorus]
Desert hearts, neon lights,

Legends in our own heads
Better than a dead end job
Better than institutional fraud

We are free

[Chorus]
Desert hearts, neon lights,
Rebels blaze through the nights.
Crypto dreams, wild and free,
We're the edge of history.
Legends in our own heads
Better than a dead end job
Better than institutional fraud
Fuck the rules
We are free
