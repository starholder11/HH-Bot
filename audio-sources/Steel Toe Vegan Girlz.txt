Prompt: grunge, riot grrrl, college radio, independent alternative

Lyrics:

Verse]
she gave me a mixed cd 
nicely wrapped in a thrift tee
so I kicked her steel toes 
then blew a kiss on her nose
that's got her in the mood
to get vegan food
and there's one place 
in this town
with falafel

[Verse]
She's so hip 
she's making me flip
gonna steal gramma's car
So we can see
that foreign movie
it's only 50 miles away 
(hey, hey hey hey)

[Build]

[Chorus]
There's only two of us
and we like each other
because we're both cool, 
not that there's no others
in this town, in this town 
(yeah, yea ahh, yey yey)

[Verse]
Its lonely here, having long bleached hair
listening to sub pop, shit no one cares about
shit no one cares about (yeah, yea ahh, yey yey)
She's looking at Oberlin, looking at Smith
She got lots of ideas that no one here cares about
(yeah, yea ahh, yey yey)

[Build]

[Chorus]
There's only two of us
and we like each other
because we're both cool, 
not that there's no others
in this town, in this town 
(yeah, yea ahh, yey yey)

[Chorus]
There's only two of us
and we like each other
because we're both cool, 
not that there's no others
in this town, in this town 
(yeah, yea ahh, yey yey)

[Refain]

[Slow]

[Soft]

[Fading Chorus]
There's only two of us
and we like each other
because we're both cool, 
not that there's no others
in this town, in this town 
(yeah, yea ahh, yey yey)

[End]
