Lyrics:

[Scat Intro]
bee dee dee dee dat doo doo doo
mmm mmm mmm miss iss ing you
how dee doo, i love you

[Verse]
Under a thatch umbrealla view
I sip my drink and thank of you
oh what do we do?
If only she knew
Just how I feel for you.
You know we've shared a man before
Don't you dare think we are whores
It's so convenient, if you're lenient
In who beds down with who

[Chorus]
Complications
Consequences
We Broke Borders
Can't Man Fences
There's No Way Around
me and you
and you and her
and us all hating
what we've become

[Verse]
I tried to keep an open mind
But an open book casts so much doubt
I read you plainly the words aren't strong
That longing so hot but the outcomes so wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
And you ain't man enough to claim the mess we make
You ain't man enough to clean the mess we all make



[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Complications
Consequences
We Broke Borders
Can't Man Fences
There's No Way Around
me and you
and you and her
and us all hating
what we've become

[Verse]
That man child so sexy and wild
Melts my cubes you know you do
But that's a just a dream with a drink
Most you'll get is a how do you do?
Cuz the real me is just to good to be true
We tried baby, we tried, 
with much stronger than you


[Chorus]
Complications
Consequences
We Broke Borders
Can't Man Fences
There's No Way Around
me and you
and you and her
and us all hating
what we've become

[End]

[End]
