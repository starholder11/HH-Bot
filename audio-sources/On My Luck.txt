hand me 
that piece
of the reef
we weren't
supposed
to steal

smash it into
the mirror
painted with
the virgin mother

let's discover
how it is to live
with the sky
two feet overhead

did you miss me?
and all the fated games
that are of no consequence
till their fatal

I ranged around
in rosy colored glasses
the world faded
warm and comfy
as fall catalogs

everyday 
we walked the dog
and twice a week
juice at the mall

that was something
but of course it blew up
up are just air bubbles
bound to pop

so dive on in
yes dive on in
while I'm down
on my luck
