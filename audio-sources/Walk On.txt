Walk On

Prompt: sumo beats, second line brass, future vaudeville


Lyrics:


[Slurring Vocals]
they staggered down easy street
locked arm in arm safe from all harm
they staggered down easy street
coins dripping from their pockets
eyes reflecting emoji rockets
it's a thing to do in this zoo
we call capitalism.
[Stirring Chorus]
Their apes and their degens
On L S T S and D Pins
changing finance upside down
acting like clowns (hold note)
over something as sacred as money

[Slurring Vocals]
feel me there ain't nothing funny
about messing with a man's money
turning that bread I give my honey
into magic internet funny money
there go those degens
staggering back from the casino
that doesn't have house rules

[Stirring Chorus]
Their apes and their degens
On L S Tees and D Pins
The luckiest fucking bastards
in this whole damn town

[Horn Instrumental]

[Stirring Chorus]
Their apes and their degens
On L S Tees and D Pins
The luckiest fucking bastards
in this whole damn town

[Fade]
[End]

[Horn Instrumental]
