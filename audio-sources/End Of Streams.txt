[Announcer (showroom voice)]
As we stand on the precipice 
Of this most momentous
Occasion 
I would like to remember
the sacrifices all those e girls
made in the time
before
The end of streams

[Instrumental (building bounce)]

end of streams

just a little bit
tripping my lines
showing my hand
just a little bit
like an itty bit
