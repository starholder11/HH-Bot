Twisted Bits

Prompt: punk priestess, downtown scene, live club performance

Lyrics:

[Verse (Soft low moaning)]
baby love me leave me
walk on out that door
baby love me leave me
walk on out that door

[Verse (rising building power)]
I'm desperate to get rid of you
The worst hurt in my life
baby love me leave me
walk on out that door

[Chorus (empowering snarl)]
You're the god
of the worst shit
I mainlined
your twisted bits

[Verse]
Sweetie my sweet sweetie
I'm gonna smack that stupid face
Nothing good can come of it
or that giddy up glazed grin
it's time to put you down
my heroin himbo
oh how did I hook up
and then hold on and on
and how I hate you now
how I hate you now

[Chorus (empowering snarl)]
You're the god
of the worst shit
I mainlined
your twisted bits

[Verse Cheer]
there's something so stupid
about even getting mad
the only thing less pathetic
is someone being sad
about you, about you

[Chorus (empowering snarl)]
You're the god
of the worst shit
I mainlined
your twisted bits

[Repeat]
[End]

[End]
