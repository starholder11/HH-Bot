Terminal City Skank

prompt: live ska from the paradise rock club in boston, open with cymbals joined by rising horns holding their notes before bursting into a classic ska beat with the full band on eighth notes, carrying a skacore energy into the song before launching into a tempo shift midway through the song, bringing it down, then taking it back up for the close




[Introduction
(Crowd: Cheering wildly)
(Singer: Speaking into the mic)]
Thank you!
we are brass
to the future
And this is a benefit show for our good friend Chaz
FREE CHAZ GUNKLIN

[Pre-Verse]
(Horn section: starting slow and low, then building)
(Drums: starting with cymbal rattles alongside horns)
(Guitar: clipped skank on the offbeat)
(Bass: Walking baseline)

Pick it up,
Pick it up
Hot diggity dog
HOT DIGGITY DAWG!
Are you ready to skank
Terminal City?

[Verse (full ska revival eighth notes)]
I’m going tilt on leverage
Down So bad, 
I need a beverage
[Trombone: sliding]
The terminal 
Is the technology
The coins
Are the new cash
A G I It’s time to die
Cuz nothing here
Nothing here
Is ever built to last
[Chorus]
I’m tripping terminal city
Minting coins like crazy
My future? Beyond hazy
When the economy
Is autonomous 
My net worth
Is anonymous 

[Verse]
Quants they come and go
Trading desks fly high
And then they blow
Every tick an up and down
Start as kings
And then turn 
to clowns
The only way to survive
Is feel the beat and ride
I don't wanna die
On a red dildo
I just wanna fly
On a green candle
Life comes fast
Love the world
And simulate the past


[Chorus]
I’m tripping terminal city
Minting coins like crazy
My future? Beyond hazy
When the economy
Is autonomous 
My net worth
Is anonymous 

[BRIDGE: SKANKIN BREAK TEMPO SHIFT
(drums: slow groove with rim and kick-snare syncopation <ska-dub>])
(bass: locked loop, dub-inspired repetition <groove>)
(guitar: clipped skank on the offbeat <minimal ska>)
(tempo: drops into stoned groove breakdown)
(mood: dubby, hypnotic, immersive)]

[Pre-Verse
(Singer: shouting out to the crowd)
(Crowd: going crazy)]
The terminal boss won’t win
Chaz Gunklin will rise again
Hup! Hup! Hup!
Hup! Hup! Hup!"
Let me see you skank!

[Instrumental 
(Trombone: wild solo)
(Guitar: going off on a riff into solo)


[Chorus]
I’m tripping terminal city
Minting coins like crazy
My future? Beyond hazy
When the economy
Is autonomous 
My net worth
Is anonymous
