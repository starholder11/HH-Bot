[pre-verse (rising chanting)]
yeah yeah
yeah yeah, yeah yeah
see you in the morning
tea toast and yawning
crystal camo fuselage

[Verse]
english garden hidden riddles
untangle cables in the yard
number station short bursts
irrigate the petaflops

{Chorus]
I'm walking
walking back
walking
walking back

[Verse]
forking out the mainframe
clearing bellows of the bats
making up for lost time
dropping packets in the stack
when you see me on a tuesday
I'm already off the end
reality is for the nomads
camping out in the lapse

[Chorus]
There's endless
Endless miles
There's endless
Endless files

yeah yeah, yeah yeah
see you in the morning
tea toast and yawning
