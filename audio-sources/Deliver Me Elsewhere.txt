Deliver Me Elsewhere

Lyrics:

[Instrumental  (monster guitar hook)]
there's a parish dance on friday
in the basement of the church
will you make it there I wonder
as I repress the urge
to walk on up and ask you
too many eyes around
small asks turn into 
everybody's business
whispers fuel the furnace
in this dead end of a town

sainted is the name
given unto you
common as a penny
still sacred to me too

I heard your older sister
has music they don't play
except for in the cities
filled with weirdos
we all drove away
I see a safety pin in denim
checks upon your shoes
a part of me is jealous
that you're already cool

can we get to college
will we pack our bags
I don't have the answer
the unknowns of our class

I've went away to swansea
when shit was really bad
you remembered that I left here
and asked about my dad
simple acts of kindness
sainted and so sweet
it's almost enough to live on
almost enough to make
me believe

generational trauma
is a fancy word they use
I'll understand it one day
until then I endure abuse

the bustle in the hedge row
the stairway to your arms
my shoulder is a head rest
we can slowly spin around
forget what comes on saturday
forget about the pain
forget about these lives
spinning down the drain
the war inside our elders
is not our cross to bare
sainted is your name
deliver me elsewhere
deliver me elsewhere
deliver me elsewhere



the war inside our elders
is not our cross to bare
sainted is your name
deliver me elsewhere
deliver me elsewhere
deliver me elsewhere
[Outro (overwhelming layered feedback reverb)]
