Bone Flute

Prompt: future lonesome,  electro americana,  lap steel souk,  fiddler downtempo dirge, 

Lyrics:

razor wire cantina
iron shavings on the floor
two bits for the barman
whiskey compass
show the way

they're worried 
about a rustler
white buffalo
by his side

he plays himself
a bone flute
the pied poacher
and his call to stray

the N F Tees all answer
wandering from their herds
a rancher has no standing
without his digital meat

emergence
it's a happening
evolved programming
is here to stay

there's just one bar in Carlson
called the Last Stand Saloon
all roads here lead to ruin
you're on your way to doom
there's no need to hurry
take a break inside

there's no need to hurry
on your way to doom
all roads lead to ruin
so pull on up to
the last stand saloon

this here's van aiken country
margaret shows the way
droid defense corps
rally who
rally who
on the frontier
of the hyperreal
we'll see you
all soon
