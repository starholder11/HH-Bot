Oil Mauve Mayday

Prompt: girl group, big guitars, wall of sound, harmonies, dream pop meets space rock

Lyrics:

[Verse]
It came on the communication wires
That big oil rig Mauve was issuing a may day
So we cottagecored ourselves like peasant girls
Went out to the barn and brought the may pole down
Oooh Oooh, you know how we do

[Chorus]
May Day means instaplay
We aren't here to serve
We say no way
We say no way

[Verse]
Nestor Makno, yeah we know all about the black army
come on barbee, let's create a stateless anarcho commie society
Power breeds parasites, you know it's true oooh oooh
oh yes you doooo ooh ooh

[Chorus]
May Day means instaplay
We aren't here to serve
We say no way
We say no way

[Verse]
Heroes who needs them around our may pole?
we know the deal with status seeking warrior societies
it just gives me such anxiety that I need to soothe (oooh oooh)
on the bosum of mutualism
before there's another schism

[Chorus]
May Day means insta play
We aren't here to serve
We say no way
We say no way

[Verse]
when this song is over there won't be a do over
we won't come back looking for cash
oh big oil mauve, let your rigs tear apart
there's no shame in having a broken heart
for to exist to exist is to be so complicit

[Chorus]
May Day means insta play
We aren't here to serve
We say no way
We say no way

[Bridge]
all we ever asked was that you respect our privacy
but you could never accept 
that we are not accepting questions
at this or any time

[Chorus]
May Day means insta play
We aren't here to serve
We say no way
We say no way

[Fade]

[End]
