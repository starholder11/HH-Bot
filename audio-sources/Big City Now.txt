Big City Now

Prompt: heavy lovers dub, low languid horns, supercrunk chopped and screwed

Lyrics:

[Verse]
many years and
many moons ago
a patch of grass
and dreams of you
laying out in morning dew
such a smile is still 
brings me now
knowing that your
still around
and I don't see you
as much as I'd like
but that's just our
lot in life
what I know
is what I feel
that's happy, happy to
be in your life
[Chorus]
just two kids
from tumbledown
living free
in the big city now
