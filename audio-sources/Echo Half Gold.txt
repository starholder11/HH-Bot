Echo Half Gold

Prompt:Create a guitar sound with massive distortion and feedback, building walls of white noise through cranked amplifiers, Use heavy fuzz boxes and distortion pedals for thick, saturated tones on the verge of breaking apart, Layer dense, overwhelming guitar textures that balance melodic sweetness with sonic violence, Contrast gentle reverb-drenched passages with explosive noise walls, Keep playing simple - basic chord progressions buried under processing, Add laconic cool male vocals with Scottish rock accent over the controlled chaos, Genre vectors: shoegaze, noise rock, dream pop, post-punk, indie rock, alternative rock



Give me a brick 
and we'll build a wall
Give me an arrow
Then we'll make it fall
Build it up
Just to tear it down
Lift me up
Put my head to the crown
Flying high
And that's A Oh Kay
start spangled banner
Got nothing to say
Punch a hole 
In heaven's gate
March on in
at the hands of fate
Nothing tomorrow
Is bringing me back
Let out the line
and pull in the slack
Let out the line
and pull in the slack
Torpedoes ready
Go flood the tubes
Missiles in crisis
Front page of the news
Next time you see me
It's in all the wrong places
Next thing you hear
Are lies filling empty spaces
Martyrs are coming
Its the saints time to go
I loved you baby
Now that's an echo half gold
