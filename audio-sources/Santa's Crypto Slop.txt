Santa’s Crypto Slop

Prompt: infinite holiday slop, girl group female vocals

Lyrics:  

<introduction>
(jingling bells)

<verse (girl group)>
I'm scrolling your Christmas Tree
liking stories about chimneys
wishing Santa would hurry on up
and lobotomize meeeeee

the chemicals in my lip gloss
got me in a holiday daze
my brain can't keep up
with the metas in the slop

<<chorus>

Christmas the season for
online crime
My favorite time of year
to take a loan 
on my N F T dearverse>
All I want is holiday dot fun
setting off an endless bull run
we're all gonna make it next year
trading shitcoins without fear
no prosecution by the S E C
now that they've canned Gary
put our seed phrases in the group chat
invite lazarus to get in on that
I heard your bridge is a one of nine multi
and leads to the land of milk and honey
its too bad your a sexless incel
but I won't dwell 
on what I'd do if you knew 
how to use that dick

on my N F T dear

<verse>
Uber eats in my ring doorbell
buzz em in and waft the smell
egg nogged spiced oat lattes
and a bucket 
of jalopeno chicken nuggets
the best benefit of 
being a  maxi
is all my food 
comes in a private taxi

<verse>
Santa has his 
naughty and nice list
but I don't believe in slashing
except when there's 
an intersubjective token
handling all of our
dispute resoluuuuution
