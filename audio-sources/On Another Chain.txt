On Another Chain

Prompt: sardonic piano ballad,Â future torch

Lyrics:

[Verse]
the gecko broke the news
what a funny way to choose
what the world thinks of you
but who am I to say, 
after all the things I said
dismissing the meme ability of you
[Short Pause]
[Verse]
If only I knew, what'd they'd do
to express their love for you
as a token of appreciation
trading units of attention

[Cloying Chorus]
The green candle's showing
What we're all knowing
That the moment 
of your meme
has arrived

[Verse]
You're a meme coin baby
oh yes it's true, my meme coin lady
and it's time for your fifteen minutes
in the exchange,
oh such a shame,
that I'm on another chain
trapped in max pain
without a bridge to get exposure to you
what to do,
when you're so far away
on another chain
it's a one way bridge to nowhere
and without a show here
I want to speculate to
I want to place my bets
on you baby


[Verse]
I want to speculate Speculate
I want to place my bets on you baby
get leveraged up all crazy
nothing else will do
but parasocial exposure
to an E R C 20
with a goofy ass
picture of you

[Cloying Chorus]
The green candle is showing
What we're all knowing
That the moment 
of your meme
has arrived

[Fade]

[End]
