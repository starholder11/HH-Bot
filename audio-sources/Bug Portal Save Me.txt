Lyrics:

[Verse]
A little lion lives inside this house
every day he searches for a mouse
to pounce, to pounce, to pounce
try as he might, he stalks in vain
spends his time staring out the window pane
our cat seeks his catch of the day
but those birds are just so far away
and he's stuck inside, what to do
this fierce beast needs to see it through

[Verse]
right by the radiator, 
there's a hole in the floor
at least to you and me, 
but there's more so much more 
that the hunting tiger imagines it to be, 
it's where, 
it's where the bugs surface suddenly


[Chrous]
Bug Portal Save Me

[Bridge]

In a flash he is off, the bug portal has spawned
transformed in an instant, our hero's time dawns
there's a jump and a crash, the battle is a blur
a scurrying grasshopper and big ball of fur


[Verse]

the noble beast looms over his prey
batting, pawing, biting, 
putting on a display
I can't bear to watch, 
I can't witness such fury
oh grasshopper, dear grasshopper 
where have you gone?
too late, too late
for your fate was sealed by, 
sealed by Luka the House Lion!

BUG PORTAL SAVE ME

Open Up and Amaze ME
