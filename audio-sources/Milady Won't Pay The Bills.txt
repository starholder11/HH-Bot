Milady won’t pay the bills

Prompt: milady schizo punk ballad, torch anthem power pop

Lyrics:

milady won't pay the bills
schizo coded
crashout cooked
mental health
where have you gone?
the timelines cracked
the faithful shook

[Chorus]
oh, what will we do
when we cease
to understand
the world?

the spinning top
is winding down
they're taking bets
on when I tilt

to the prediction market
get my skin in the game
flay off bits 
as a hedge
push me closer
to the ledge
milady won't pay the bills

In despair
I'm not a trillionaire
at the age of seventeen
Oh three is coming to 
One shot me
where do we go
when nothing lasts
as capital flows

[Chorus]
oh, what will we do
when we cease
to understand
the world?

generational wealth
missed every other day
insanity collapsing on itself
turning inside out
making me wretch up
all my lost liquidity
chunks of Jay pegs
strewn all over memes
dripping down the bowl
minting this disease
layer twos are where we sing the blues
milady won't, no she won't
pay the bills

[Chorus]
oh, what will we do
when we cease
to understand
the world?

generational wealth
missed every other day
insanity collapsing on itself
turning inside out
making me wretch up
all my lost liquidity
chunks of Jay pegs
strewn all over memes
dripping down the bowl
minting this disease
layer twos 
gimme a noose
milady won't, no she won't
pay the bills

[Chorus]
oh, what will we do
when we cease
to understand
the world?

[END]

good bye
my sweet 
dear gary
lets play atari
sometime at the atrium
where the has beens
still hang out 
at the shopping mall
they all wished, 
they all wished
for our downfall
now let's grab
an orange julius
and drool until
dementia
becomes our mental
censor
milady won't
no she won't
pay the bills
[Chorus]
oh, what will we do
when we cease
to understand
the world?
[END]
