Lyrics:

[Verse]
I hit the chicken shack 
Asked for Armenian jerk
Got the side eyed reply
That I didn't owe enough
To draw that sort of heat
Keep it in Glendale they said
That's some heavy weight to carry

[Verse]
Upon reflection my reflux can't survive
An Armenian ulcer, smothered in 
Hot sauce vigs, stale cologne cigs
So how about some oxtail soup
But the droop behind the counter smiled
Said that wasn't good style
As ordering oxtail gets pretty wild

[Chorus]
This dudes gatekeeping 
Keeping the menu off limits 
Judging my disorders
Based on food orders

[Verse]
I don't get this meanness
Banging Bao Buns off Seamless
Social interactions bring such traction
maybe this is why
All the accelerationists try
Soylent, bars and celsius

[Chorus]
Soylent, bars and celsius
To hell with this 
Take my fucking order
Before I call in Mordor

Ended up with a deep fried tower
stacked with rings of power
And in the center was 
A boiling cauldron of chili
stewed through the age of elves
with gautemalan insanity peppers
call me a prepper 
but the age of man can't stand
When all our time is devoted to
burning a hole through
stomach linings, oh the timing
please remember me as that guy
who enjoyed a good pulled pork
cuz when the orcs overrun five guys
and cut fries down from supersize
no one will rise up 
from our mobility scooters
just keep clicking the computers
as the age of man gets banned
like styrofoam cups, load us in a dump truck
and bury us as honored
lords of the landfills

[Chorus]
Soylent, bars and celsius
To hell with this 
Take my fucking order
Before I call in Mordor

[Verse]
poor smeagol became a monster
after they banned him from red lobster
that's no way to foster, good relations
between our kinds and all the droids who
live beyond the shire, controlled by wire
forming an evil borg, 
sworn as loyal swords
to the international house of isengard

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
poor smeagol became a monster
after they banned him from red lobster
that's no way to foster, good relations
between our kinds and all the droids who
live beyond the shire, controlled by wire
forming an evil borg, 
sworn as loyal swords
to the international house of isengard
coupon cutting us to pieces
gobbling up promo codes
and using them to power magic spells
a two for one at in and out
is like a jack in the box for evil wizards
drown us in DQ blizzards
and send us off to the food court
across the sea
there's no mystery
let's get fat and hope they call us back
for a reboot of the species
when the studios run out of better things to do

[Chorus]
Soylent, bars and celsius
To hell with this 
Take my fucking order
Before I call in Mordor

[Instrumental]
