Lyrics:

<Verse>
Xannah dew what can I do?
When you have control of me
All this time I had thought
that I bought 
what I copped
but you made a fool
out of me

<chorus>
Xannah dew, Xannah dew (ooh ooh)
what can I do
when you have
control over me?

<verse>
how many times
must I be rugged?
before I quit
this quick fix drug
Oh I got it bad bad baaad
strung out on
pump dot fun
just rip and run

<chorus>
Xannah dew, Xannah dew (ooh ooh)
what can I do
when you have
control over me?



<verse>
how many times
must I be ruggd?
before I quit
this quick fix drug
Oh I got it bad bad baaad
strung out on
pump dot fun
just rip and run

<chorus>
Xannah dew, Xannah dew (ooh ooh)
what can I do
when you have
control over me?

<Verse>
I'm jonesing hard
got hooked till
I've lost my handle
now I'm addicted
to those green candles
mainlining liquidity pools
I'm such a fool

<chorus>
Xannah dew, Xannah dew (ooh ooh)
what can I do
when you have
control over me?

<Verse>
Sometimes I think
about going back to my N F Tees
but those days are
so far behind me
Now I'm just
a trench lizard
hoping to hit
just one million X winner

<chorus>
Xannah dew, Xannah dew (ooh ooh)
what can I do
when you have
control over me?

[End]
