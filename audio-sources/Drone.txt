[Verse 1  (narcotic whisper floating over tremolo decay)]
Salt and silver in the satellite array
You ghost through frequency modulations
We breathe mercury under amber floods
Brief as cesium half-life, twice as dangerous
[Chorus (sedated menace building to crushing inevitability)]
Beautiful strangers
Swimming through impossible physics
We collapse
We collapse
Like opiates through bloodstream
[Verse 2  (intimate dissolution)]
Your pulse frequencies match the radar sweep
We float in electromagnetic amber
The desert watches through compound eyes
While we dissolve into our component atoms
[Chorus (heavier, more poisoned)]
Beautiful strangers
Swimming through impossible physics
We collapse
We collapse
Like opiates through bloodstream
[Bridge (pharmaceutical whisper through analog decay)]
For seventeen minutes
We were chemically perfect
For seventeen minutes
We forgot how to die
[Final verse - beautiful destruction in slow motion]
Dawn breaks like bad medicine
The technicians find only residue
But the particles are still dreaming
Of what we were before we separated
[Outro (voice dissolving into tape saturation)]
We collapse
We collapse
Like opiates through bloodstream
Beautiful strangers
Swimming through impossible physics
We collapse
