Hollow Thy

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Head on my shoulder, got my head on my shoulder
No disrespect, out plowing the streets, no snow
Salt rocks in the box, cover goldilocks
In stocks and bonds, always long cuz I'm strong
Check the balance sheet, credit to these streets
Turn it up, no butts, shoulder rub
[Chorus]
Hollow thy anger
Hollow my heat
You cover me
I'll underwrite you
[Verse 2]
Market maker in the fog of war
Got deals on deals and still want more
Salt rock profits stack to the door
Each trade a trap, each loss a score
Numbers dance but I keep it straight
Plowing these streets till markets break
[Chorus]
Hollow thy anger
Hollow my heat
You cover me
I'll underwrite you
[Verse 3]
Slipping through shadows in the coastal haze
Market's crashing but I count these days
Terror in the streets when the truth comes out
Drill down deeper till you clear the doubt
Bottom line showing what we already know
Follow the money watch it ebb and flow
[Chorus]
Hollow thy anger
Hollow my heat
You cover me
I'll underwrite you
[End]

[Verse 1]
Head on my shoulder,
