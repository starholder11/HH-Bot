Floating Flower Pots

prompt: choir in a canyon, harmony on harmony, cherubic folkdrone


press head to pillow
close eyes for the night
trace the sound of the last car
on the causeway coming home
the sea surrounds us in our sleep
dreams in oversized bathtubs
paddling around in flower pots
rubber whales pushing us along
you're a tulip on the horizon
a bulb bouncing on sweet saline
desperate to keep the dutch
from dragging you into the undertow

tell me I'm a good egg
pluck me from the soup
and wrap your lips
around the broth 
that glazes me

I'm a flunky gone to heaven
harmonious in afterhours
no one's asking questions
it's just my brain performing defrag
cleaning out the cluttered neurons
dusting off the circuits
rearranging memories
like knick knacks on grandma's shelves
whose to say I've never made it
whose to say I can't compete
here in afterhours I'm undefeated
floating in my flower pots
serenading rubber duckies
cuz their the ways that never drown
it's just the quacks always around

tell me I'm a good egg
pluck me from the soup
and wrap your lips
around the broth 
that glazes me
