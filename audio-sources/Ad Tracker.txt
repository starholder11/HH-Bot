Lyrics:

[Gregorian Chant]

[solemn Verse]
in these hours of eternal idiocy
you strive to win every moment
in these days of empty attentions
you train deep eyes inside our minds

[powerful Chorus]

[solemn Verse]
engagement farming harvests eyeballs
but I miss the listicles of yore
return to the clickbait teasers
serve me banner ads galore

[Bridge]
you've captcha'ed my heart
now record it to my P I I
I'm accepting every offer
Ignore the GDPR


[powerful Chorus]
