  "lyrics": "[Instrumental Intro]\n\n[Verse (haunting ethereal)]\nthey put chips inside your eyes\nrecording all you see\neven as you sleep\ndo chips dream \nof reflections that you see\na collide a scope\nantennas phoning home\nI was once alive\nOn a Tuesday \nwalking down the lee side\nof a volcano\nthrough switchblade grass\nthinking this can't last\nonly to die a thousandth time\nI taste like vodka soda inside\nI'm so behind the times\nthat I flat circle around myself\nhere's to vampiric health\nbesides rising from the dead\nI ponder my old poetry\nto see traces of the soul\nthat never formed\n\n[Break]\n[Bridge]\n\n[IPre-Verse]\nSend me to bedlam\nPut me on the path to Plath\nOh what I'd do \nfor mother's little helper\nTell me the disorder\nAnd I'll pantomime today\n\n[Chorus]\nHere's to vampiric health\nHere's to vodka in my veins\nHere's to dead inside\nAs a way to be alive\n\n[Verse]\nI hit the highs\nAnd the lows\nOn a flat line\nFeelings are behind me\nI need to be reminded\nTo fake my relations\nBecause like the dead\nOne thing they still unite against\nis a sociopath, I need a pathway\nto passing as normal in unstable times\nHelps with the climb\nNot that I care except to survive\nthey raise the rates, rob us blind\nI'm in a taxi, that revolutionary\nCall it praxis, denying access to \nthe ride shares. I'm off location\nA mental vacation that I find \nsuits my mind",
