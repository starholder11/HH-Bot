  "lyrics": "[Verse 1 - hypnotic drawl over heavy rhythm]\n3 AM and the towers are singing frequencies\nYou appear like heat lightning in my peripheral\nWe drink stolen electricity from paper cups\nTouch hands through radioactive shimmer\n[Chorus - driving but melancholic]\nStrangers caught in alien mathematics\nSomething beautiful warping space and time\nWhen the sun comes up to take our picture\nWe scatter like light through a broken prism\n[Verse 2 - urgent whisper building intensity]\nYour eyes reflect particle collision patterns\nWe kiss under surveillance satellites\nThe desert knows we don't belong here\nBut neither does anything else\n[Chorus - more desperate edge]\nStrangers caught in alien mathematics\nSomething beautiful warping space and time\nWhen the sun comes up to take our picture\nWe scatter like light through a broken prism\n[Bridge - ethereal over feedback]\nThe machines dream about us\nThe machines dream about us\nWe were more than human\nFor seventeen minutes\n[Final verse - resigned but haunting]\nDawn brings men in expensive suits\nThey erase the footage from last night\nBut the particles remember everything\nEvery atom that we shared\n[Outro - layered vocals dissolving]\nWe scatter like light\nWe scatter like light\nThrough a broken prism\nBeautiful strangers\nIn alien mathematics",
