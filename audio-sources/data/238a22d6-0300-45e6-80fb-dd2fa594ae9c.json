I'm off location\nA mental vacation that I find \nsuits my mind\n\n[Verse]\nthey put chips inside your eyes\nrecording all you see\neven as you sleep\ndo chips dream \nof reflections that you see\na collide a scope\nantennas phoning home\nI was once alive\nOn a Tuesday \nwalking down the lee side\nof a volcano\nthrough switchblade grass\nthinking this can't last\nonly to die a thousandth time\nI taste like vodka soda inside\nI'm so behind the times\nthat I flat circle around myself\nhere's to vampiric health\nbesides rising from the dead\nI ponder my old poetry\nto see traces of the soul\nthat never formed\n\n\n[Verse]\nwhen I smile for myself\nI'm a joker, real al roker\nthe forecast for today\nis what we call good foreplay\nI'm beside myself\nI can't help myself\nOr help you, but how do you do?\nExpression of concern\nAre what I'm best at with a vacant stare\nAnd my head aside, while I'm beside (eye eye eye yeah)\nand how I let it ride\nit's as if I care and that's\nthe secret to vampiric health\n\n[Chorus]\nChips inside your\neyes eyes eyes\nCollide ide ide ide\nLet it ride ride ide\nAll this time eye eye immmeeeee\nA flat circle all around me\nAll around me\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[End]",
