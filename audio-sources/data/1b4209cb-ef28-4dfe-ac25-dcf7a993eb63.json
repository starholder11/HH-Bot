  "prompt": "a chopped and screwed dub-influenced sub-bass treatment to music that fuses hypnotic Colombian cumbia and champeta rhythms with massive dub sub-bass drops, Layer organic percussion (hand drums, maracas) with crisp electronic beats, Add sparse, echo-drenched vocals floating in reverb clouds, Mix traditional Colombian instrumentation (accordion, gaita flutes) that suddenly dissolve into digital glitches, Maintain a danceable groove while experimental electronic elements create moments of beautiful disorientation, The result should feel like a tropical soundsystem broadcasting from the future",
