  "prompt": "live ska from the paradise rock club in boston, open with cymbals joined by rising horns holding their notes before bursting into a classic ska beat with the full band on eighth notes, carrying a skacore energy into the song before launching into a tempo shift midway through the song, bringing it down, then taking it back up for the close",
