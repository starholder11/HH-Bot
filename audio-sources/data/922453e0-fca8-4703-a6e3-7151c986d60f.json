  "prompt": "Lush dreamy shoegaze textures with dense reverb-washed guitars float over propulsive, anthemic drums and soaring synths in the verses, The chorus blooms into rich ensemble vocals and glimmering pads, then melts into a groovy acid yacht rock bridge with bright keys, wah guitar, and a steady funk-inflected bass, The outro layers ethereal synths and swirling effects, fading on a sea of ambient textures",
