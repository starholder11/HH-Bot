[Bridge (backmasked orchestra)]
[Pre-Verse (slow strum acoustic guitar)]
Did you get the
depleted uranium
that I sent to you?
It has a half life
of four point five
billion years.
That's a very low rate of decay
A thing like that can just stay
as it seeps through you
tearing part your atoms
and putting back the bits
into a brand new version
of me and you.

[Chorus]
just a trace of 
u two three five
let you know
that I'm alive
and missing you

[Verse]
sending you letters
marked with
radiation postage
pop it in lead lining
oh how my heart is pining
a nuclear fueled reaction
picking up traction
spilling my words
in the heaviest bits of stars
I'm falling apart
much faster than the 
rate of decay 
in this stamp
that travels your way


[Chorus]
just a trace of 
u two three five
let you know
that I'm alive
and missing you
