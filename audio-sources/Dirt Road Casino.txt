Lyrics:

[Intro]

[Verse]
Technicals technicals hop on in the hilux
our warlord needs protection, protection
we are off to the dirt road casino
the dirt road casino

[Chorus]
Heavy is the head
Who invents a crown
Heavy hangs the head
Of He who 
invents his crown

[Intro]

[Verse]
counterfeit kalashnakovs are shooting up the slots
russian roulette alphabets ringing out their shots
deer hunter, deer hunter how desperate your last cry
deer hunter, deer hunters, how desperate your final cries

[Chorus]
Heavy is the head
Who invents a crown
Heavy hangs the head
Of He who 
invents his crown

[Verse]
crypto economic space jams
under the banner of Mars
our pleasure palace ponzi
must be defended with arms

[Chorus]
Heavy is the head
Who invents a crown
Heavy hangs the head
Of He who 
invents his crown

[Build]

[Verse]
Airdropping automatic fire from AMM clips
Burying weak hands who never buy the dip
technicals technicals we reign supreme
technicals technicals fighting for the dream

[Chorus]
Heavy is the head
Who invents a crown
Heavy hangs the head
Of He who 
invents his crown
