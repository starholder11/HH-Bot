Monte Carlo Blues

prompt:slide bass, deep baritone voice, slow trombone, soft baritone sax



sky is high with antennas 
broadcasting in the night
they missed me at casino
I'm growing listless
with them monte carlo blues
baby can you carry?
I'm rather poorly known
in these parts
just a baggy in your bra
hand to my heart
glad to be together
so hard to be apart
