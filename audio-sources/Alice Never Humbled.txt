Distinguished visitors from around the globe...the brightest minds...nobel prize runners up....shamanic researchers....para psychic astrologers....everyone is here to witness an epic confrontation between strategos maximus.

[Pre-Verse (rising)]
sweetie you are 
so saucer eyed
honey dripping bliss
words melting 
off your lips
gentle euphoric waves
echoing for days
my girl 
untangling her life
spooling out the lies
putting them aside
truth is touching
there's gratitude in you
quivering inside
spilling out your mind

[Chorus]
We're going places
borderless beyonds
lifting alongside
going for the ride

[Bridge]
melting down
giving in
butterscotch
bubble past
the brim

[Verse]
There's no sinning
There's no winning
There's no catches
Or cheap clauses
No bad vibes
to give us pauses
onwards now
we hear the calling
tumbling and falling
into the hole
we tumbled
alice never humbled
nothing else to do
but smile
and melt with you

[Chorus]
We're going places
borderless beyonds
lifting alongside
going for the ride

[Outro]
Take me 
Inside your mind
Take me
Behind the lines
That separate
us from
becoming
to the sweet
homecoming
