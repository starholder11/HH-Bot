Strange Slates

prompt:big beat, electro psychedelica, wave function, new romantic fuzzbox



cookie puss n boots
knocking back celebrity
call me to the stage
delivering the keys
no notes,
this is a criminal conspiracy

strange love, you're left as memory reflecting on the surface a skipping stone of how it used to be when it was still you and me oooh oooh ooh

arthurian excalibur pull the sword eyes from my stoned serendipity because I refuse to see that there's no one looking back when I turn to find you

persistent,
drift from reality
my life
has no cause ality
random things
acting on me
hop scotch
deterritorializing
stable concepts
can't find
common ground
when I'm around

strange love, you're left as memory reflecting on the surface, a skipping stone of how it used to be when it was still you and me oooh oooh ooh

formulaic equations traded for occasions gorillas in sierra mist with a twist, a half cap enough to trigger relapse, put me on blast, cee cee everyone and announce my involuntary leave of absence 

I'm in my mind palace
serenading the duchess of depravity
begging her to hook me up
with a healthy dose of gravity
sendl me back to clown town
and lets process my trauma
through a critical interpretation
of beverly hills chihuahua
