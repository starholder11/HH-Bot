Collision Course of Cool

Prompt: liquid blue money, headhunter driving synths, neon chrome pulsetron

Lyrics:

[Shadowy Verse]
wilshire in december
driving empty nights
doing killer work
contract high on my own supply
heavy hooded dark shades
reflecting the night back out
electric lights soaking in my pulse
I'm hunting you down, coming hard
you know this
you know its tonight
we settle this
only one can survive
this collision course of cool

[Bridge]

[Verse (slick showroom delivery)]
wilshire in december
driving empty nights
doing killer work
contract high on my own supply
heavy hooded dark shades
reflecting the night back out
electric lights soaking in my pulse
I'm hunting you down
you know this

[Chorus (new romantic croon)]
you know its tonight
we settle this
only one can survive
this collision course of cool
