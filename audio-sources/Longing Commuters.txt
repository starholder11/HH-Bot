Longing Commuters

Prompt: new romantic, vaporwave, tokyo lounge music, chopped and screwed

Lyrics:

[Intro]

[Pre-Verse]
Weary Commuters
Eyeing each other
Longing for better
Always longing
Makes me think 
Of You

[Verse (female torch)]
We used to smoke 
in the dining car
They had that minuet, 
it made me just melt
Two dry martinis, 
our hands wrapped around
[Breathy Pause and Build]

[Chorus]
Tell me you remember
how good we traveled
All the places I took you
As we thundered down the tracks

[Pre Verse]
When you picked me 
up off the tracks
Pirouetting through the passengers
Forgetting our partners, 
forgetting our cares


[Chorus]
Tell me you remember
how good we traveled
All the places I took you
As we thundered down the tracks

[Pre-Verse (breathy female lounge)] 
Weary Commuters
Eyeing each other
Longing for better
Always longing
Makes me think 
Of You

[Verse (female torch)]
We used to smoke 
in the dining car
They had that minuet, 
it made me just melt
Two dry martinis, 
our hands wrapped around
[Breathy Pause and Build]

[Chorus]
Tell me you remember
how good we traveled
All the places I took you
As we thundered down the tracks

[Pre Verse (breathy female lounge)]
When you picked me 
up off the tracks
Pirouetting through the passengers
Forgetting our partners, 
forgetting our cares


[Chorus]
Tell me you remember
how good we traveled
All the places I took you
As we thundered down the tracks

They had that minuet, 
it made me just melt
Two dry martinis, 
our hands wrapped around
[Breathy Pause and Build]

[Chorus]
Tell me you remember
how good we traveled
All the places I took you
As we thundered down the tracks

[Pre Verse (breathy female lounge)]
When you picked me 
up off the tracks
Pirouetting through the passengers
Forgetting our partners, 
forgetting our cares


[Chorus]
Tell me you remember
how good we traveled
All the places I took you
As we thundered down the tracks
