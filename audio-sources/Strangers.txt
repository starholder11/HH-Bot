Strangers

prompt: raw tremolo high mojave desert rock meets paisley underground wistful southwest in a haunted quiet loud quiet of wide open spaces and strange broken hearts


[Verse 1 - hypnotic drawl over heavy rhythm]
3 AM and the towers are singing frequencies
You appear like heat lightning in my peripheral
We drink stolen electricity from paper cups
Touch hands through radioactive shimmer
[Chorus - driving but melancholic]
Strangers caught in alien mathematics
Something beautiful warping space and time
When the sun comes up to take our picture
We scatter like light through a broken prism
[Verse 2 - urgent whisper building intensity]
Your eyes reflect particle collision patterns
We kiss under surveillance satellites
The desert knows we don't belong here
But neither does anything else
[Chorus - more desperate edge]
Strangers caught in alien mathematics
Something beautiful warping space and time
When the sun comes up to take our picture
We scatter like light through a broken prism
[Bridge - ethereal over feedback]
The machines dream about us
The machines dream about us
We were more than human
For seventeen minutes
[Final verse - resigned but haunting]
Dawn brings men in expensive suits
They erase the footage from last night
But the particles remember everything
Every atom that we shared
[Outro - layered vocals dissolving]
We scatter like light
We scatter like light
Through a broken prism
Beautiful strangers
In alien mathematics
