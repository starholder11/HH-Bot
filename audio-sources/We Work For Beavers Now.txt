We Work For Beavers Now

There was a mishap at the lab, last blood moon
The moths fell from the sky, crunched under feet for days
We boiled our water and waited for instructions
Three days later a government train arrived
They positioned at the junction, halted traffic
Afraid to enter the perimeter, sending drones instead
We made campfires, cooked hot dogs, drank coors
It was like being on holiday in your backyard, only quarantined
Insurance cut everyone loose, policies were canceled 
And only then did the men in the hazmat suits approach
Geiger counters clicking whirring, we just laughed and asked
Did you go to college for this job? 
Are your wives nervous that you're here?
How good is hazard pay?
They cut benefits you know
This is an excluded zone now
We are stateless, can't serve anymore
Uncle Sam won't let us sign up
You know it's bad when the government
doesn't want you to kill for them anymore.
But the moths came back
Millions upon millions of them
So did the deer and the bears
Seems being outside everyone
Is an attractive thing to animals
So we work for the beavers now
Blocking off the water, keeping it for us
When no one wants you there's a freedom
Makes a person industrious
Ha ha, yeah we are pioneers plotting
A takeover of the lab.
Let's continue the work
They're all so scared of now.
