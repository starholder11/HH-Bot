Stick Em Up Fever (Live In Brixton)


Prompt:live punk, harsh raw distortion


he's just a lad
with a walking stick
spent his life 
laying bricks
worked all day
at father and sons
until his mate 
flashed a gun

they got the (eh eh eh eeeh)
stick em up fever
went robbing 
old men outside
the betting shops

knocking over punters
was an easy thing to do
running off with spare quid
and buying quualudes

life was getting sloppy
they turned their action
to the tracks
follow out the winners
and whack em in the backs

they got the (eh eh eh eeeh)
stick em up fever
went robbing 
racing fans for cash

One evening Billy said
I know where real money is
Not these track day punters
But the club on Silver Street
Where the posh toffs 
go drinking
wearing gold watches
Catch em on the way home
Too pissed to put up a fight

out came
billy and the barneys
who only speak polari
dandy queens and carnies
running action in the baths

The wanna bees watched
From a flophouse cross the street
Look at 'em fancy lads
soft hands make easy marks

Little did they know
The queens had their own racket
Years of street survival
And knives hidden in jackets
The boy pulled his gun
But Billy didn't startle
Just flashed a crooked smile
As the Barneys circled

it went down
as bad as you'd expect
boy and his mate
got proper wrecked
put in their place
for the lack of respect

a gun can give you power
if someone fears the barrel
but what happens 
when they dont flinch?

You end up in a ditch
needing a walking stick
just to drag yourself
on back home
[Instrumental]
[Guitar Solo]
Good byeeeeeeee
To the stick em' up fever
Nothing cures a boy
like a good hard beating
retreat on back to bricks
better than getting 
the shit kicked 
out of you
out of yoouuuu
out of you, you you
[End]
