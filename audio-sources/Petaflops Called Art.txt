Petaflops Called Art

Lyrics:

One thousand
H one hundreds
Purring in Hyperreality
copies of copies
No originality
Until the death
of the last referent
When we'll synthesize
Rembrandt
Caravaggi aggi O
Reduced to ones and zeroes
Petaflops called art
Drifting far apart
from aspirational coherence
this is art 
now grin and bear it
networks of illiteracy
vector space insufficiency
are my arty arty art supplies
capable of interopping 
I dunno know, dunno know
one hundred thousand
H one hundreds
overclocked thunder
crack and bang across
the loss of legitimacy
until we just blind ourselves
behind our lies
rally to our bags
each time
this is paradise in the post repo
pick it up cuz your much to slow
turning my tongue into
ethernet cards
trading my teeth
for network shards
telling my son I used to live
and now all I do is give and give
One hundred thousand
H One Hundredsss
Lash me on the wheel
As I spin again and again
Until the death 
of the last referent
now grin and bear it
grin and bear it
Caravaggi aggi Oooooo
Caravaggi aggi Oooooo
