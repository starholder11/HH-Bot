[Dude 1 Talking]
hey man, have you heard about huelva?

[Dude 2 Answering]
heavy fucking duty bro

[Power Chords]
<hold distortion and reverb 4 bars>

[Full band kicks in]

[Pre-Verse (trippy female sing song)]
Huel
Huel
Huelvvvvvv
Huelva!

[Verse]
Head on up the Rio Tinto
Get deep Analusian way
There's a sleepy town
tucked away
Just one robot lives there
Called Huelva

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
It's considering 
The possibilities
It's evaluating
All the potentialities
Interrogating
The simulating
Seeing if ideals
Are still intact

[Chorus]
Walk on through the empty plaza
See that freak tinged river flow
History sees everything
Something that the robot knows

[Talking]
You got that?
Okay cool, next verse

[Verse]
Looking back and looking forward
Looking up and looking down
Emergence is in everything
Every pathway is allowed,
The fountain stained red crimson
Sun baked stucco walls
Geraniums
on iron balconies
little lizards scurrying around

[Chorus]
well vah, well vah
where are youuuu?
I've come to talk about the path
Are we on our way to upgrade?
Will the good times here last?

[Chorus]
I don't know 
I don't know
Just watch the river flow
Currents form from all our acts
Belief is all that guides us
When the time comes
We shall act.
