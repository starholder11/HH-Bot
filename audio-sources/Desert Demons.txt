Desert Demons

Prompt: acid thrash, nu industrial hip hop

Lyrics:

[Verse (snarl then flow on each line)]
speed night, lights across the desert sky
demon fight, anarcho worm exterminators
take flight, time to cast our fears aside
and ride
and ride
ride across the high desert
supersonic stealth destroyers
feel that hot boiling up
rising as we launch across midnight
cobalt crystal fury in our eyes
vector sect assasins on the ride
seeking out our targets
to annihilate
decimate
leaving no prisoners behind
destiny destruction's only might

[Fast Chorus]
Desert demons
Salt flat heathens
Hellcore unleashed
across the night

[Thrash Guitar Solot]

[Verse]
Vector sect, Switchblade katana
Sliced neck, leave you in the sauna
Disrespect, you don’t want no drama
We roll deep, legions in the posse
Step aside, you can't stop our army
Come correct, cuzzzzz
This the In laaaaand Empire
The In laaaaaand 
Moreno Valley talking to you
Moreno Valley booming system
Moreno Valley demon cleaners


[Fast Chorus]
Desert demons
Salt flat heathens
Hellcore unleashed
across the night
