Ivanpah Romantics

prompt:raw tremolo high mojave octane meets paisley underground longing quiet loud quiet of wide open spaces and interrogated hearts


[Verse 1 - hypnotic drawl over desert drone]
Midnight frequency sweep through the antenna array
You materialize like interference patterns
We share cigarettes that taste like copper ions
Brief as muon decay in the detector grid
[Chorus - building melancholy urgency]
Beautiful strangers in impossible physics
Temporary as particles in free fall
We collapse, we collapse
Like everything good and brief
[Verse 2 - intimate but distant]
Your pulse echoes off the parabolic dishes
We dance to signals from dead galaxies
The desert holds us like a wave function
Until someone turns on the lights
[Chorus - more desperate]
Beautiful strangers in impossible physics
Temporary as particles in free fall
We collapse, we collapse
Like everything good and brief
[Bridge - whispered confession]
For seventeen minutes
We were quantum entangled
For seventeen minutes
We existed
[Final verse - resigned beauty]
Dawn erases our coordinates from the system
The data shows no anomalous readings
But the atoms remember what we were
Before observation killed the magic
[Outro - layered vocals fading to static]
We collapse, we collapse
Like everything good and brief
Beautiful strangers
In impossible physics
We collapse, we collapse
