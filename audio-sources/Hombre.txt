Lyrics:

Champion
Champion
Whoop Whoop
Gimme the 
Bombastic
Drop me 
At the 
Highstepper
Roll us down
the strip baby
glittering with 
the drip milady
Heaven chopper
Val Kilmery
Flat Earthing
Like I'm Kyrie
Asking Questions
You can't answer
Seriously
Step off and spin it
Serve then volley


Pomegranates
At the Big 
Sombrero
Just Bad Hombres
Jack in the boxers
Reverse rug dubbing
Nothing troubling
About the bass
mace facebook
all it took
Got you hook
Line and sinker
In my trapper 
Keeper 
I’m time hacking
See my Slack DM
PM Dawn of
Mega mega tron
Whoop Whoop
Gimme the Bombastic
Whoop Whoop

Imma Bridge Over
Troubled Saunas
Franchise Owner
Of Benihana
Punky Brewsters
Millions In 
Teenage debt
Sense of regret
Stack it high
Let it fly and 
Walk on to the
Morning dawn
and see the AM calm

[Chorus (shift to downtempo lovers)]
(smooth voice)
In da club
In da mood
See you sway
Girls you slay
Oh my gawd
How you floss
Be my boss

[Verse]
Whoop Whoop
Gimme the 
Bombastic
Drop me 
At the 
Highstepper
Roll us down
the strip baby
glittering with 
the drip milady
Heaven chopper
Val Kilmery
Flat Earthing
Like I'm Kyrie
Asking Questions
You can't answer
Seriously
Step off and spin it
Serve then volley
