Lyrics:

[Pre-Verse]
Alebrijes! Alebrijes! Alebrijes!
Zapatos, Zapatos, Zapatos
Arepas, Arepas, Arepas
Sacapuntas, Sacapuntas

[Pre-Verse]
Alebrijes! Alebrijes! Alebrijes!
Zapatos, Zapatos, Zapatos
Arepas, Arepas, Arepas
Sacapuntas, Sacapuntas

[Slow Verse]
I see them scraping by
As I slide from town to town
Always around on the corner
Washing windows, cooking dinner
But what can I say?
I haven't learnt the language
And I only really communicate online
Anymore
What is there to say?
As a nomad, I'm nothing to this place
Just taking up space
Another backpack
Another mac book
Another hoodied guy
Who needs sunscreen
Staring at his phone
As I pass on by
Always passing by


[Verse]
Don't ask me why
I'm easily amused
The answer will
leave you confused
Confusion is my calling
And stickers on my mac book
I'm that guy who asks for wifi
Then fucks off and hides

[Pre-Verse]
Alebrijes! Alebrijes! Alebrijes!
Zapatos, Zapatos, Zapatos
Arepas, Arepas, Arepas
Sacapuntas, Sacapuntas
Chupa cabra chupa cabra
cobra kai cobra kai cobra kai

[Verse]
Call me gringo, call me nerd
Nothing I've not heard
Passing down the coast
As I pretend to surf
while pretending to work
Committing code to three repos
Drawing paychecks from all over
Covid's come and gone
But I'm not going back
Living out of a backpack
And running up the Air B N Bees
Butch and Sundance gone too far
No plans on going back

[Pre-Verse]
Alebrijes! Alebrijes! Alebrijes!
Zapatos, Zapatos, Zapatos
Arepas, Arepas, Arepas
Sacapuntas, Sacapuntas
Chupa cabra chupa cabra
cobra kai cobra kai cobra kai



[Bridge]

[Verse]
milady milady

I love you
I'm that guy
who asks for wifi
And fucks off and hides

[Pre-Verse]
Alebrijes! Alebrijes! Alebrijes!
Zapatos, Zapatos, Zapatos
Arepas, Arepas, Arepas
Sacapuntas, Sacapuntas
Chupa cabra chupa cabra
cobra kai cobra kai cobra kai

[Verse]

I love you
there is no meme
I love you
I'm that guy
who asks for wifi
And fucks off and hides

[Pre-Verse]
Alebrijes! Alebrijes! Alebrijes!

Chupa cabra chupa cabra
cobra kai cobra kai cobra kai
