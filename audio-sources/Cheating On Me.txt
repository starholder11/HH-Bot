Cheating On Me

Prompt: glitch guitar, muscle car stomp, guerilla cheerleader, internetcore, chopped and screwed IDM

Lyrics:

[Pre-Verse (female stadium power)]
I got garlic around my neck
Yeah it's that time again
Just another season
With just another reason
To drive a stake in your heart

[Verse]
Three's no forgetting
All that blood letting
Or that my cousin came to you
Asking to do that thing you do
You keep biting around
The whole damn town
I'm forced to put you down
Even if your as handsome
As the day you died.

[Chorus]
I'd invite you inside
But want you to die
Another time
For cheating on me

{Instrumental}

[Verse]
I get my loving from the coven
those witches are bitches
but they know what to do
with ingredients 
that belong between the sheets
I'm not complaining
It's much better than draining
There's only so much I can give
Before I'm passed out on the floor
And that you see (see eee eeee)
Is the problem with immor tal ity

[Chorus]
I'd invite you inside
But want you to die
Another time
For cheating on me

{Instrumental}
