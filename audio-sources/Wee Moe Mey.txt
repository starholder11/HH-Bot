Lyrics:

oooh oooh oooh
 ah ah ahh
oooh oooh oooh
 ah ah ahh

wee moe may
wee moe may
dawn of the day
its the dawn
of the day

I should walk out
silver studded
diamonds dusted
across my soles

I should walk out
silver studded
diamonds dusted
across my soles

wee moe may
wee moe may
dawn of the day
its the dawn
of the day

give me loving
call me cherished
I will promise
loves becoming
in the direction
of your hugging

wee moe may
wee moe may
dawn of the day
its the dawn
of the day
