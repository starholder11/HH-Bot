Still Raw

prompt:intelligent dance torch music


salted 
a second too long,

seasoned
left to shrivel
in the wake
of your tastes,

talk about me
like a piece of meat
once chewed

I'm digested now
you'll be hungry again
'cept there's nothing 
but the bones

do I get a goodbye?
scraps scattered
cross fries

this is a diner song
pour the sugar
stir the straw
wash it down

I'm still raw
