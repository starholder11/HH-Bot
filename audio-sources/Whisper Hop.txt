Lyrics:

I believed that I believed in you
not cynically at all
I'm in awe as I evolve
You are ocean sized
And I am but a flutter on the moon
a flicker in the cosmos
 an echo in the ether
But people fade and I forget
People fade and I forget
There's another side
Another side of me
Another side to you
But people fade
and I forget
