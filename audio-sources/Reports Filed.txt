Lyrics:

[Verse]
Cyan is the sound
Ultra violet counter cleaner
Hexi decimal vengeance
Running up my arms
Pawning the lucky charms
You'll see me as I see you
A hit on facial recognition
Key in the ignition

[Chorus]
Always out for more
One more time
Just to show you 
That I mean
Business


[Bridge]

[Verse]
Am I getting through to you?
Have reports been filed about me
Is a team assembling?
There's an all points out on you
Compromise your cloud
It's Hopeless hon
I'm coming to the office
Try to stop me
in a server room 
showdown

[Tempo Change]

[Chorus]
Always out for more
One more time
Just to show you 
That I mean
Business


[Tempo Change]

[Chorus]
Always out for more
One more time
Just to show you 
That I mean
Business
