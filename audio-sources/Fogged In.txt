Fogged In

Prompt: acid yacht, sunsplash amplitude, barfly soaked, leisure phonk

Lyrics:

<Verse>
Fog rolling in
the transmission wires
just fade away
like every other day
I think of you
And better times
Just out of grasp
Not built to last
Like a calendar
running out of days

<Chorus>
The bar will be filled tonight
Everyone in town
Comes on down
And we get fogged in
Fogged on in

<Verse>
Zero Cooper is a good friend of mine
We drink our wine and talk all day
Tall tall tales that get away from us
In the blur and rush
kicked that jug of blush
The gentleman whinos
Hanging at the sea wall
Admire us as we hop the bus
And drive away just liked the day
Into the fog of it all, of it all


<Chorus>
The bar will be filled tonight
Everyone in town
Comes on down
And we get fogged in
Fogged on in

<Verse>
I'm as hiiighhhhh
as a Siamese cat
Prowling the alleys
Searching for some stink
to get myself on into
the street gypsies
all know my beat
they nod as I walk on
slapping hands and 
stealing kisses from nans
that know better not to
ooh ooh ooooh

<Chorus>
The bar will be filled tonight
Everyone in town
Comes on down
And we get fogged in
Fogged on in

<Verse>
As me and Zero stagger home
the fog will break and the moon will shine
and we'll laugh and we'll sing
howling it was such a good time
and on our way home now
we're on our way home now
the night air's sweet and we are free
and we're on our way home now
mmmmm hmmmm
yeah yeah
on our way home
<Instrumental Fade Out>
<End>
