Lyrics:

[Pre-Verse]
(intensifying whispers)
I'll see you when I wake
I'll see you when I wake
On the other side
Lift the veil
up from
my eyes

[Instrumental Hook}
(quiet loud quiet)

[Chorus]
Gone away
Strayed off
From the herd
Gone awaaay
Strayed off 
From the herd
Past perception
In search of 
A Beyond

[Verse]
I still remember
What you said to me
As the train pulled away
On that fateful day....
And how they took you
From my grasp
It was the last good goodbye
Before the world was torn to shreds

[Instrumental (thundering guitars)]

[Chorus]
Gone away
Strayed off
From the herd
Gone awaaay
Strayed off 
From the herd
Past perception
In search of 
A Beyond

[Verse]
Will you be waiting
When I push through the veil?
Will you greet me
On the shores of 
The hidden harbor?
Or was that just
A childish game we played?
I'm coming after you
I'm coming after you
Be waiting my love
Or I'll hunt you down
And bind you in the soma dreams
That we used to share
I'll bind you to me
In the lost haze of a dream
Glaze your eyes
Give that heart to me
There's no freedom
Only what was meant to be

[Chorus]
Gone away
Strayed off
From the herd
Gone awaaay
Strayed off 
From the herd
Past perception
In search of 
A Beyond

Be waiting my love
Waiting my love
to follow 
the paths 
in the soma dreams
we used to share

[Bridge (droning guitar feedback)]

[Chorus]
Gone away
Strayed off
From the herd
Gone awaaay
Strayed off 
From the herd
Past perception
In search of 
A Beyond

[Chorus (layered vocoder)]
Out shine
Out shine
OUT SHINED
OUT OUT SHINED

[End]
