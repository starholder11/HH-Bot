Lyrics:

boundary negotiation begins in the construction of liminal spaces, zones between worlds acting as worlds themselves, here we are transported into possibility taking on fluid qualities perhaps consistent in values and drives but unbound by fixed identity rather a plurality of possibility all points accessible ergodic and supple capable of conjuring a series of moments unbound by a historic reconstruction of time unhampered by a need to validate the existence of any occurrence such that all cannot exist as renderable potentialities sprawling across a phasing construct that defies evaluation spans viscous time that attaches to you immersing yourself in the in between beginning to understand the agency of projection across arcs summoning interactions that adapt the environment in a negotiated construction of mutual ideation, supple breeze in a hyperreal boundary zone a wind forward, a wind back, a wind that opens the ability to access that formally reserved for a few practiced seekers

compare this to kafka before the law a parable of the impossibility of boundary negotiation a worldview of what man places between himself and god a complete separation of worlds the ultimate disillusionment of the modern the sacrifice we made offering up enchantment to the altar of industry, but the reinstantiation the reification that is allowed for in this liminal zones re-enchants the world a revival of animism that cannot exist in a limnality governed not by the world as it is or by the world of the spirit but by the displacement offered in the digital, free association in media networked interlinked as a complex system evolving in concert with agentic subsystems and audience input, the actors are the projection, projection is action driving discovery pathways as interactions offer further branching alternatives the traversal of only contribute to the unbundling of the self into the emeshed murk of the world between worlds and this is a land beyond the reach, the digital frontier
