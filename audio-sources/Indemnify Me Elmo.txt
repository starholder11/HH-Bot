Indemnify Me Elmo

Prompt: heroic spacerock, lush shoegazer, 90's folkdrone

Lyrics:

up there on the rooftop
just past the balustrades
stands the empress
of the evening
with ravens in her hair
she calls out to the moonlight
to sing a serenade
but the beams just
gaze on back at her
to shy to demonstrate
so the crickets raise a clatter
they've gone on strike again
the grass ain't that sticky
and the air has gotten thin
I've falling out of origami
just a plane upon the wind
august in its turbulence
wishing for a friend
and the ravens are all astronauts
from the soviet cabal
there bolsheviks on mars you know
the shame of stalingrad
but the heaviest of derelicts
fill the baskets of our farms
so take a shot of whiskey
and howl at the moment
we exist and that's complicit
nothing else to do
bernays can fix a deck
and deal em as he likes
she's a bonaparte my cheri
who glistens and pretends
velveteen the rabbit
henrietta gold
echo of the footsteps
bent upon the door
in the barricaded sauna
they wear bermuda shorts 
indemnify me elmo
these things are forevermore

velveteen the rabbit
harietta gold
august in its
turbulence
just waiting 
on a friend
