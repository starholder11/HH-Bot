TITLE: Digital Wanderer
PROMPT: A folk-acoustic song about searching for authentic connection in a technology-driven world
LYRICS:
(Verse 1)
Walking through the city streets, phone in hand
Scrolling through the endless feeds, I don't understand
How we got so far apart, yet connected all the same
Looking for a beating heart in this digital game

(Chorus)
I'm a wanderer in the digital dawn
Searching for something real before it's gone
In the static and the noise, I hear a call
To find the truth that lies beneath it all

(Verse 2)
Coffee shop with glowing screens, no one speaks
Everyone's a curator of their perfect weeks
But behind the polished posts and curated lies
I can see the loneliness reflected in their eyes

(Chorus)
I'm a wanderer in the digital dawn
Searching for something real before it's gone
In the static and the noise, I hear a call
To find the truth that lies beneath it all

(Bridge)
Put the phone away, look up at the sky
Remember how it feels to be alive
The world is still here, waiting to be found
Beyond the notifications and the sound

(Outro)
Maybe we can find our way back home
To a place where we don't feel so alone
Digital wanderer, lay your burden down
The real world's waiting to be found
