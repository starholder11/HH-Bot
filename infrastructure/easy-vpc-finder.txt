ðŸ“‹ COPY THESE 3 THINGS FROM AWS CONSOLE:

1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com
2. Search: "VPC"
3. Click: "VPC Dashboard"

STEP 1: Get VPC ID
- Click "Your VPCs"
- Copy the VPC ID (looks like: vpc-1234567890abcdef0)

STEP 2: Get Public Subnet IDs
- Click "Subnets"
- Look for subnets with "Auto-assign public IPv4: Yes"
- Copy 2 subnet IDs (looks like: subnet-123abc, subnet-456def)

STEP 3: Get Private Subnet IDs
- Still in "Subnets"
- Look for subnets with "Auto-assign public IPv4: No"
- Copy 2 subnet IDs (looks like: subnet-789ghi, subnet-012jkl)

If you only see public subnets (or only 2 total), that's fine -
we can use public subnets for both in testing.

PASTE THEM HERE:
VPC_ID: vpc-CHANGEME
PUBLIC_SUBNET_IDS: subnet-CHANGEME1,subnet-CHANGEME2
PRIVATE_SUBNET_IDS: subnet-CHANGEME3,subnet-CHANGEME4

Then I'll update the config automatically!
