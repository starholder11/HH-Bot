# ðŸš€ LanceDB Infrastructure - Final Deployment

## âœ… Status: Ready to Deploy!

Everything is prepared and configured:
- LanceDB container built & pushed to ECR
- VPC and subnets configured
- OpenAI API secret created
- CloudFormation templates ready
- Deployment script tested

## ðŸ”‘ Final Step: Admin AWS Credentials

**Current Issue:** User `hh-bot-s3-uploader` lacks CloudFormation permissions.

**Solution:** Switch to admin AWS credentials temporarily.

### Quick Deploy (30 seconds):

1. **Switch to admin AWS credentials:**
   ```bash
   aws configure
   # OR
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-admin-key"
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-admin-secret"
   ```

2. **Deploy infrastructure:**
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure
   source final-config.sh && ./deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Switch back to regular credentials after deployment**

### What Gets Deployed:
- **EFS Storage**: Persistent storage for LanceDB
- **ECS Fargate Cluster**: Scalable container service
- **Application Load Balancer**: Public HTTP endpoint
- **Auto Scaling**: CPU/Memory based scaling
- **Security Groups**: Proper network isolation

### Deployment Time: ~10-15 minutes

### Expected Output:
```
[SUCCESS] EFS storage deployed
[SUCCESS] ECS cluster deployed
[SUCCESS] LanceDB service running at: http://your-alb-url.amazonaws.com
```
