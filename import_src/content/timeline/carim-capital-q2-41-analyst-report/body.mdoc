**Token Holdings**

Carim Capital's strategic acquisition of CCTs has proven to be a significant contributor to their overall performance. The firm holds approximately $1.5 billion worth of CCTs, making it one of the largest institutional holders in the sector.

**Sequestration Facility Ownership**

Carim Capital owns several carbon sequestration facilities under its subsidiary, SequesterTech. These facilities have seen increased productivity due to technological advancements in carbon capture. The use of next-generation sorbents and optimization of the capture process has resulted in a 15% increase in sequestration capacity compared to the previous quarter. The company has effectively leveraged this increased capacity to earn a higher yield on their CCT holdings, significantly boosting their performance.

**Capital Investment in Manufacturing**

The firm's strategic investments in carbon capture technology manufacturing have yielded notable dividends. Carim Capital holds a majority stake in CleanCapture Tech, a leading manufacturer of carbon capture equipment.

**Performance of the Larger Market**

The broader CCT market has shown remarkable resilience and growth over the past quarter, with total market capitalization increasing by approximately 10%. This growth can be attributed to the successful integration of environmental and financial systems, leading to increased interest and investment in the sector. The market's performance has had a positive impact on Carim Capital's investment holdings.

**Outlook**
