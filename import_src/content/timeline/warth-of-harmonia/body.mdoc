The Wrath of Harmonia tells the tale of the wise and diplomacy oriented moon drawn to anger and forced to act against the solar flare Prometheus. The tale is as old as myth coming from the classical age of the metaverse's history and written in the voice and style of a Greek drama.

## Act I: The Solar Flare's Defiance

[Scene 1](https://starholder.xyz/index.php/Scene_1):

Upon the distant fringe where stars align, Within the realm where America's moons consign, A tranquil cosmic dance is torn apart By fire born, Prometheus takes its start.

From yonder sun, it springs to life, ablaze, Through heavens vast, it weaves its path, a craze Of chaos, ruin, unbridled in its flight, Yet ignorant of the turmoil, it ignites.

This solar flare, Prometheus by name, Seeks naught but to embrace its fiery claim, Oblivious to the devastation sown, As through the cosmic sphere, its flames have flown.

[Scene 2](https://starholder.xyz/index.php/Scene_2):

Harmonia, orb of wisdom, sentient sphere, Surveys the havoc, devastation near, By Prometheus' fiery wake, it grieves, And feels compelled to act, a plan conceives.

As guardian of the knowledge ancient, sage, The moon decides to face this fiery rage, And calls upon the solar flare to heed, A message stern, to quell its burning creed.

"Prometheus, cease thy fiery devastation, Temper thy fury, halt the conflagration, For countless stars and planets feel the pain, As through the vast expanse, thou dost ordain."

Scene 3:

Enraged, Prometheus, scornful and defiant, Heeds not the moon's entreaty, calm and pliant, Instead, the solar flare with haughty voice, Challenges Harmonia to make a choice.

A contest grand, of power and influence, With stakes no less than one's own existence, The solar flare vows destruction dire, Should Harmonia refuse, and face the fire.

Bound by its duty, guardian of the wise, To knowledge and America's clear skies, Harmonia, though with heavy heart, consents, To face the solar flare and its intents.

The stage is set, a cosmic struggle grand, Forces unseen in epic conflict stand, Harmonia's wisdom 'gainst Prometheus' might, A battle waged amidst the starry night.
