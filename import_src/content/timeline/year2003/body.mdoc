## The Year In Review:

In 2003, the Starholder timeline was punctuated by events that beautifully blended the surreal with the tangible, immersing its inhabitants in tales that explored both personal and metaphysical dimensions.

The first notable narrative, "New Years 2003," follows Virgo Legacy as he grapples with the dawning realization of a world tilting towards absurdity. Observing a Pakistani destroyer in the early morning hours, Virgo reflects on his lost familiarity with a world he once understood deeply. This represents not just personal loss but echoes a larger sense of displacement felt within the Starholder community—a society increasingly alienated by rapid technological and geopolitical shifts.

Simultaneously, the year embraced the mystical allure of the past through "Capulet Oasis," a story revolving around the legendary Capulet Oasis. This enigmatic stop, founded in the late 1950s, transformed into a spectral presence by 2003, roaming as an apparition through various physical and temporal locations. It highlighted the theme of memories and legacies haunting the present, providing a historiographical exploration into the depths of familial and societal memory within Starholder.

In the poignant reflection "Never Even Caught His Name," Eleanor sits at an old oak table, reminiscing over a photograph that throws her back into a youth linked arm-in-arm with spectral memories. This narrative delicately weaves the personal with the historic, showcasing how personal stories and memories contribute as much to the fabric of the Starholder timeline as any grand event.

These stories from 2003 collectively explore the themes of legacy, memory, and the haunting of the past—both literal and metaphorical—within the ever-evolving spectacle of Starholder. Blurring the lines between the once-was and what might be, they invite the readers to ponder the essence of continuity and change in a world that itself oscillates between reality and phantom presences.
